The essay differentiates between two types of suicide: "worldly" suicide and "nihilistic" suicide.

- **"Worldly" suicide** is driven by loss or failure in life's pursuits. This type of suicide might be seen as an attempt to escape from a temporary disruption in an otherwise perceived "good" life. For example, the essay mentions the suicide of a businessman who lost his job or a person who was recently broken up with. The essay suggests that individuals in these situations experience a "slight 'opening up' of Nihilism" due to the destruction of what they find meaningful in the world. However, the essay questions whether this type of suicide is "authentic" since it is driven by attachment to worldly distractions.
- **"Nihilistic" suicide**, in contrast, stems from a deep engagement with the existential realization of life's meaninglessness. The essay suggests that this type of suicide may be seen as more "authentic" because it is not an escape but a deliberate choice aligned with the individual's embrace of the void. The essay uses the suicide of Mitchell Heisman as an example of a "nihilistic" suicide. Heisman committed suicide after writing a 2,000-page manifesto on Nihilism.

The essay ultimately leaves open the question of whether suicide is a rational response to the realization of life's absurdity or a failure to find a more profound response to the void.
