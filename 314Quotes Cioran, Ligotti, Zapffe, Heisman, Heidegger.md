# 18. Emile Cioran

## _**On the Heights of Despair**_

**\- “****why can't we stay closed up inside ourselves? why do we chase after expression and form, trying to deliver ourselves of our precious contents or"meanings," desperately attempting to organize what is after all a rebellious and chaotic process? wouldn't it be more creative simply to** **surrender to our inner fluidity without any intention of objectifying it, intimately and voluptuously soaking in our own inner turmoil and struggle? then we would feel with much richer intensity the whole inner growth of spiritual experience all kinds of insights would blend** **and flourish in a fertile effervescence. a sensation of actuality and spiritual content would** **be born, like the rise of a wave or a musical phrase. to be full of one's self, not in the sense of pride, but of enrichment, to be tormented by a sense of** _**inner infinity**_**...”** (me- Molinos says this almost exactly)

**\- “only a few can endure such experiences to the end. there is always a serious danger in repressing something which requires objectification, in locking up explosive energy, because there comes a moment when one can not restrain such overwhelming power. and then the fall is from too much plenitude. there are experiences and obsessions one cannot live with. salvation lies in confessing them. the terrifying experience of death, when preserved in consciousness, becomes** **ruinous. if you talk about death, you save part of yourself. but at the same time, something of your real self dies, because objectified meanings lose the actuality they have in consciousness.”**

**\- “the deepest subjective experiences are also the most universal, because through them one** **reaches the original source of life.** _**true interiorization leads to a universality inaccessible to those who remain on the periphery.**_**”**

**\- “the vulgar interpretation of universality calls it a phenomenon of quantitative expansion** **rather than a qualitatively rich containment. such an interpretation sees lyricism as a peripheral** **and inferior phenomenon, the product of spiritual inconsistency, failing to notice that the lyrical resources of subjectivity show remark able freshness and depth. there are people who become lyrical only at crucial moments in their life; some only in the throes of death, when their** **entire past suddenly appears before them and hits them with the force of a waterfall. many become lyrical after some decisively critical experience, when the turmoil of their** **inner being reaches paroxysm. thus people who are normally inclined toward objectivity and impersonality, strangers both to themselves and to reality, once they become prisoners of love, experience feelings which actualize all their personal resources. the fact that almost everybody writes poetry when in love proves that the resources of conceptual thinking are too poor to** **express their inner infinity; inner lyricism finds adequate objectification only through fluid, irrational material.”** (a great description of Tillich's ideas of Religious Symbolism)

**\- “the experience of suffering is a similar case. you never suspected what lay hidden in yourself and in the world, you were living contentedly at the periphery of things, when suddenly those feelings of suffering which are second only to death itself take hold of you and transport you** **into a region of infinite complexity, where your subjectivity tosses about in a maelstrom. to be lyrical from suffering means to achieve that inner purification in which wounds cease to be mere** **outer manifestations without deep complications and begin to participate in the essence of your being.”**

**\- “there is no authentic lyricism without a grain of interior madness. it is significant that the beginnings of all mental psychoses are marked by a lyrical phase during which all the usual barriers and limits disappear, giving way to an inner drunkenness of the most fertile, creative kind.”**

**\- “the lyrical state is a state beyond forms and systems.”**

**\- “how distant everything is! i don't understand why we must do things in this world, why we**

**must have friends and aspirations, hopes and dreams. wouldn't it be better to retreat to a faraway corner of the world, where all its noise and complications would be heard no**

**more? Then we could renounce culture and ambitions; we would lose everything and gain nothing; for what is there to be gained from this world? there are people to whom gain is unimportant, who are hopelessly unhappy and lonely. we are so closed to one another! and yet, were we to be totally open to each other, reading into the depths of our souls, how much of our**

**destiny would we see? We are so lonely in life that we must ask ourselves if the loneliness of dying is not a symbol of our human existence. can there be any consolation at the last moment? this willingness to live and die in society is a mark of great deficiency. it is a thousand times preferable to die somewhere alone and abandoned so that you can die without melodramatic**

**posturing, unseen by anyone. i despise people who on their death bed master themselves and**

**adopt a pose in order to impress. tears do not burn except in solitude. those who ask to be surrounded by friends when they die do so out of fear and inability to live their final moments**

**alone. they want to for get death at the moment of death. they lack infinite heroism. why don't they lock their door and suffer those maddening sensations with a lucidity and a fear beyond all limits? we are so isolated from everything! but isn't everything equally inaccessible to us? the deepest and most organic death is death in solitude, when even light becomes a principle of death.** _**in such moments you will be severed from life, from love, smiles, friends and even from death. and you will ask yourself if there is anything besides the nothingness of the world and your own nothingness**_**.”** (Would Tillich agree with this?)

**\- “on not wanting to live. there are experiences which one cannot survive, after which one feels that there is no meaning left in anything. once you have reached the limits of life, having**

**lived to extremity all that is offered at those dangerous borders, the everyday gesture and the usual aspiration lose their seductive charm.”** (Bach is needed, right Heisman?)

**\- “the most terrifying intensification bursts into nothingness. you grow inside, you dilate madly until there are no boundaries left, you reach the edge of light, where light is stolen by night, and**

**from that plenitude as in a savage whirlwind you are thrown straight into nothingness.”**

**\- “at the edge of life everything is an occasion for death...every experience is in this case a leap into nothingness.”**

**\- “did not all the mystics feel that they could not live after their great ecstasies? what could they expect from this world, those who sense, beyond the normal limits, life, loneliness, despair, death?”**

**\- “the passion for the absurd. there are no arguments. Can anyone who has reached the limit bother with arguments, causes, effects, moral considerations, and so forth? of course not. for**

**such a person there are only unmotivated motives for living.** _**on the heights of despair, the passion for the absurd is the only thing that can still throw a demonic light on chaos. When all the current reasons- moral, esthetic, religious, social, and so on - no longer guide one's life, how can one sustain life without succumbing to nothingness? Only by a connection with the absurd**_**, by love of absolute uselessness, loving something which does not have substance but which simulates an illusion of life.”** (sounds like Tillich's concrete religious symbols)

**\- “i feel i must burst because of all that life offers me and because of the prospect of death.**

**i feel that i am dying of solitude, of love, of despair, of hatred, of all that this world offers me.**

**with every experience i expand like a balloon blown up beyond its capacity. the most terrifying intensification bursts into nothingness.”**

**\- “i live because the mountains do not laugh and the worms do not sing. the passion for the absurd can grow only in a man who has exhausted everything, yet is still capable of undergoing awesome transfigurations.** _**for one who has lost everything there is nothing left in life except the passion of the absurd.”**_

**\-** **“what else in life could still move such a person? what seductions? some say: self-sacrifice for humanity, the public good, the cult of the beautiful, and so forth. i like only those people who have done away with all that - even for a short time. only they have lived in an absolute**

**manner. only they have the right to speak about life.”**

**\-** _**“only the sick man is delighted by life and praises it so that he won't collapse.”**_

**\- “true solitude is the feeling of being absolutely isolated between the earth and the sky. nothing should detract attention from these phenomena of absolute isolation: a fearfully lucid intuition**

**will reveal the entire drama of man's finite nature facing the infinite nothingness of the world. solitary walks - extremely fertile and dangerous at the same time, for the inner life - must take place in such a way that nothing will obscure the solitary's meditation on man's isolation** **in the world. Solitary walks are propitious to an intense process of interiorization especially in the evening, when none of the usual seductions can steal one's interest. then revelations about the** **world spring from the deepest corner of the spirit, from the place where it has detached itself from life, from the wound of life. to achieve spirituality, one must be very lonely. so much death-****in-life and so many inner conflagrations.”**

**\- “I am: therefore the world is meaningless.”** (Ha! how many times has this been said out loud?)

**\- “life is the privilege of mediocre people. only mediocrities live at life's normal temperature; the**

**others are consumed at temperatures at which life can not endure, at which they can barely breathe,** _**already one foot beyond life.**_**”**

**\-** _**“i propose the agony method to rid you of all these imperfections. apply it to every generation and its effects will soon be evident. maybe in this way i too could become useful to mankind!**_

_**bring every man to the agony of life's last moments by whip, fire, or injections, and through terrible torture he will undergo the great purification afforded by a vision of death. then free him and**_

_**let him run in a fright until he falls exhausted. i warrant you that the effect is incomparably greater than any obtained through normal means. if i could, i would drive the entire world to agony to achieve a radical purification of life; i would set a fire burning insidiously at the roots of life, not to**_

_**destroy them but to give them a new and different sap, a new heat. the fire i would set to the world would not bring ruin but cosmic transfiguration. in this way life would adjust to higher temperatures and would cease to be an environment propitious to mediocrity. and maybe in this dream, death**_

_**too would cease to be immanent in life.”**_ (take psychedelics correctly, Mckenna)

_**\- “**_**i'm speaking of a precise painful sensation, not a vague and undetermined one. as in a hallucinatory dream, you feel that only your head is left, without foundation and support, without a body.”**

_**\- “**_**it is a weariness which consumes and destroys. no effort, no hope, no illusion can satisfy you any longer. shocked witless by your own catastrophe, unable to think or to act, caught in cold and**

**heavy darkness, solitary as in moments of profound regret, you have reached the negative limit of life, its absolute temperature, where the last illusions about life freeze.”**

_**\- “**_**i call agonic only those dramatic moments in the battle between life and death when the presence of death is experienced consciously and painfully. true agony occurs when you pass into nothingness through death, when a feeling of weariness consumes you irrevocably and death**

**wins. in every true agony there is a triumph of death, even though you may continue to live after those moments of weariness. there is nothing imaginary in this turmoil. every agony bears a conclusive stamp.** _**isn't agony similar to an incurable sickness which torments us intermittently (me- Sickness Unto Death)?**_ **agonic moments chart the progress of death in life, revealing a drama in our consciousness caused by the disruption of the balance between life and death. such moments**

**are not possible except in** _**that sensation of weariness which brings life down to its absolute negative value.”**_

**\- “i want to die but I am sorry that I want to die. this is the feeling experienced by those who abandon themselves to nothingness.”** (Kierkegaard, Tillich _courage to be pg 11_)

**\- “how good it would be if one could die by throwing oneself into an infinite void!”**

**\- “the complexity of the grotesque born out of despair resides in its capacity to indicate an inner infinity and to produce a paroxysm of the highest tension.”**

**\- “it is evident to** _**anyone who understands the multiple forms of inner drama that the grotesque hides secret tragedies, indirectly expressed.**_ **whoever has seen his face grotesquely disfigured can never forget it, because he will always be afraid of himself.”**

**\- “one loses one's sense of security and the normal sensation of the immediate and the concrete.”**

**\- “the truly awful thing in madness is that we sense a total and irrevocable loss of life while we are still living.”**

**\- “in death one loses everything, by a fall into nothingness. that is why the fear of death is persistent and essential, but actually less strange than the fear of madness, in which our semi-presence creates an anxiety more complex than the organic fear of the total nothingness of death. but wouldn't madness be an escape from the misery of life?”**

**\- “i would like instead a shower of warm light to fall from me, transfiguring the entire world, an**

**unecstatic burst of light preserving the calm of luminous eternity. far from the concentrations of ecstasy, it would be all graceful lightness and smiling warmth. The entire world should float in this dream of light, in this transparent and unreal state of delight.** _**obstacles and matter, form and limits would cease to exist.**_ **then let me die of light in such a landscape.”**

**\- “there are questions which, once approached, either isolate you or kill you outright. afterward you have nothing more to lose. from then on, your erstwhile "serious" pursuits- your spiritual**

**quest for more varied forms of life, your limitless longing for inaccessible things, your elevated**

**frustration with the limits of empiricism- all become simple manifestations of an excessively exuberant sensibility, lacking the profound seriousness which characterizes the man who has penetrated the realm of dangerous mysteries****.”**

_**\- “**_**only the organic and existential thinker is capable of this kind of seriousness, because truth for him is alive,** _**born from inner agony and organic disorder rather than useless speculation.**_ **out**

**of the shadow of the abstract man, who thinks for the pleasure of thinking, emerges the organic man, who thinks because of a vital imbalance, and who is beyond science and art.”** (Huxley said this about art, I find philosophy to be 'useless speculation, rather than a concern about the Truth of existence)

**\- “to step into death does not mean, as commonly believed, especially by christians, to draw one's**

**last breath and to pass into a region qualitatively different from life.** _**it means, rather, to discover in the course of life the way toward death and to find in life's vital signs the immanent abyss of death.”**_

_**\- “but why is the experience of agony so rare? Can it be that our hypothesis is entirely false and**_ _**that sketching a metaphysics of death is possible only by accepting death's transcendental nature?”**_

**\- “from a grave perspective, every step in life is a step into death and memory is only the sign**

**of nothingness.** _**the average man, deprived of metaphysical understanding**_**, does not have this consciousness of progressive advance into death, though neither he nor anyone else can escape its inexorable destiny. but when consciousness becomes independent of life, the revelation of death**

**becomes so strong that its presence destroys all naiveté, all joyful enthusiasm, and all natural voluptuousness. to have the consciousness of death is something perverse and extremely corrupt. the naive poetry of life, its seductions and charms, appear empty of content.** _**equally empty are man's finalizing projects and his theological illusions.”**_

**\-** _**“whoever has not experienced the awful agony of death, rising and spreading like a surge of blood, like the choking grasp of a snake which provokes terrifying hallucinations, does not know the demonic character of life and the state of inner effervescence from which great transfigurations arise. such a state of black drunkenness is a necessary prerequisite to understanding why one wishes the immediate end of this world.”**_

**\- “happy the man who could abandon himself to this becoming and could absorb all the possibilities offered each moment, ignoring the agonizingly problematic evaluation**

**which discovers in every moment an insurmountable relativity.”**

**\-** _**“the revelation of death's immanence in life occurs during illnesses and long depressive states.**_

_**there are, of course, other ways, but they are accidental and individual, and do not have the same potential for revelation as illness or depression.”**_

**\- “only those who truly suffer are capable of of genuine content and infinite seriousness...there are many who would gladly give up metaphysical revelations, obtained through despair, agony, and death, in exchange for a naive love or the voluptuous unconsciousness of dance.”**

**\-** _**“these states, in which separation from the world steadily and painfully increases, bring man closer to his inner reality and cause him to discover death in his own subjectivity. a growing interiority progresses toward the essential center of subjectivity, overcoming all the social forms which usually mask it. once beyond this center, progressive interiority discovers the region**_

_**where life mingles with death, where man has not yet detached himself from the primary sources of existence, where the demonic rhythm of life works with complete irrationality. in cases of depression, the awareness of death's immanence in life creates an atmosphere of constant dissatisfaction and restlessness that can never be appeased.”**_

**\-** _**“the fear of death, which is nothing but the fear of the nothingness into which death throws us, proves that death presupposes nothingness.”**_

**\-** _**“even though belief in eternity is necessary as historical man's unique consolation, the catastrophic ending of this tragedy of life and of man in particular will demonstrate the illusion of such naive faith.”**_

**\- “those who try to eliminate the fear of death through artificial reasoning are totally**

**mistaken, because it is impossible to cancel an organic fear by way of abstract constructs. whoever seriously considers the question of death must be afraid. Even those who believe in eternity do so because they are afraid of death. there is in their faith a painful effort to save - even without an absolute certitude-** _**the world of values in which they live and to which they contribute, an effort to defeat the nothingness inherent in the temporal and attain the universal in eternity. Death met without religious faith leaves nothing standing.”**_

_**\- “yet other philosophies and doctrines say almost nothing about death. the only valid attitude is absolute silence or a cry of despair. some people maintain that the fear of death does not have a deeper justification, because as long as there is an i there is no death, and once dead there**_

_**is no i any longer. these people have forgotten about the very strange phenomenon of gradual agony. what comfort does this artificial distinction between the i and death offer a man who has a strong premonition of death? what meaning can logical argument or subtle thought have for someone deeply imbued with a feeling of the irrevocable? all attempts to bring existential questions onto a logical plane are null and void. philosophers are too proud to confess their fear of death and too**_

_**supercilious to acknowledge the spiritual fecundity of illness. their reflections on death exhibit**_

_**a hypocritical serenity; in fact, they tremble with fear more than anyone else. one should not forget that philosophy is the art of masking inner torments.”**_

_**\- “**_**the art of dying cannot be learned, because there is no technique, there are no rules. the irrevocability of agony is experienced by each individual alone, through infinite and intense suffering. most people are unaware of the slow agony within themselves.** _**for them there is only**_

_**one kind of agony, the one immediately preceding the fall into absolute nothingness. only such moments of agony bring about important existential revelations in consciousness.**_ **that is why they expect everything from the end instead of trying to grasp the meaning of a slow revelatory agony. the end will reveal too little, and they will die as ignorant as they have lived.”**

**\- “**_**isn't nothingness, then, salvation?**_ **but how can there be salvation in nothingness? if salvation**

**is nearly impossible through existence, how can it be possible through the complete absence of existence? since there is no salvation either in existence or in nothingness, let this world with its eternal laws be smashed to pieces.”**

**\- “the sensation of expansion toward nothingness present in melancholy has its roots in a weariness characteristic of all negative states. this weariness separates man from the world. life's intense rhythm, its organic inner pulse, weakens. weariness is the first organic determinant of knowledge. because it creates the necessary conditions for man's differentiation from the world, weariness leads one to the perspective which places the world in front of man.”**

**\- “man grows wings in melancholy not in order to enjoy the world but in order to be alone. what** **is the meaning of loneliness in melancholy? isn't it related to the feeling of interior and exterior infinity?”**

**\- “melancholy detachment removes man from his natural surroundings. his outlook on infinity** **shows him to be lonely and forsaken. the sharper our consciousness of the world's infinity, the more acute our awareness of our own finitude. in some states this awareness is painfully depressing, but in melancholy it is less tormenting and sometimes even rather voluptuous.**

**the disparity between the world's infinity and man's finitude is a serious cause for despair; but** **when one looks at this disparity in states of melancholy, it ceases to be painful and the world appears endowed with a strange, sickly beauty.”**

**\- “nothing is important.** _**how important can it be that i suffer and think?**_ **My presence in this world will disturb a few tranquil lives and will unsettle the unconscious and pleasant naiveté**

**of others.** _**although i feel that my tragedy is the greatest in history- greater than the fall of empires - i am nevertheless aware of my total insignificance. i am absolutely persuaded that i am nothing in this universe; yet i feel that mine is the only real existence.**_ **if i had to choose between the world and me, i would reject the world, its lights and laws, unafraid to glide alone in absolute nothingness.** _**although life for me is torture, i cannot renounce it, because i do not believe in the absolute values in whose name i would sacrifice myself.**_**”**

**\- “i wonder whether a truly metaphysical feeling is even possible without the disappearance of superficial forms? one reaches the center of life only by purifying it of contingent and accidental**

**elements.”**

**\- “metaphysical existentialism is born out of ecstasy in front of the world's primordial origins; it** _**is the ultimate intoxication, ecstatic bliss in the contemplation of essence.”**_

**\- “i see a form of madness, not of knowledge, in the ecstasy of life's ultimate origins. You cannot experience it except in solitude, when you feel as if you were floating above the world. solitude is the proper milieu for madness. it is noteworthy that even the skeptic can experience this kind of ecstasy. does not the madness of ecstasy reveal itself through this odd combination of certitude and essence with doubt and despair?**”

**\- “the world in which nothing is solved. to doubt and yet to live - this is a paradox, though not a tragic one, since doubt is less intense, less consuming, than despair. abstract doubt, in which** **one participates only partially, is more frequent, whereas in despair one participates totally and** **organically. not even the most organic and serious forms of doubt ever reach the intensity of despair.** _**in comparison with despair, skepticism is characterized by a certain amount of dilettantism and superficiality. i can doubt everything, i may very well smile contemptuously at the world, but this will not prevent me from eating, from sleeping peacefully, and from marrying. in despair, whose depth one can fathom only by experiencing it, such actions are possible only with great effort**_**. On the heights of despair, nobody has the right to sleep. thus a genuinely** **desperate man cannot forget his own tragedy: his consciousness preserves the painful actuality of his subjective torment. doubt is anxiety about problems and things, and has its origins in the unsolvable nature of all big questions**_**.**_ **if such questions could be solved, the skeptic would revert to more normal states.** _**The condition of the desperate man in this respect is utterly different: if all**_

_**problems were solved, he would not be any less anxious, since his anxiety arises out of his own**_

_**subjective existence.**_ _**Despair is the state in which anxiety and restlessness are immanent to existence. nobody in despair suffers from problems, but from his own inner torment and fire.**_ **it's a pity that nothing can be solved in this world. yet there never was and there never will be anyone who would commit suicide for this reason.”**

**\- “one must descend all the circles of an inner hell to turn one's destiny into a subjective yet universal problem.”** (Kierkegaard)

**\- “only great and dangerous contradictions betoken a rich spiritual life, because only they**

**constitute a mode of realization for life's abundant inner flow. people who know only a few spiritual states and never live on the edge do not have contradictions, because their limited** **resources cannot form oppositions.”**

**\- “rich spiritual life must know chaos and the effervescent paroxysm of illness, because in them** **inspiration appears to be essential for creation and contradictions become expressions of high** **inner temperatures.** _**nobody who does not love chaos is a creator, and whoever is contemptuous of illness must not speak of the spirit.”**_

**\- “I know nothing more disgusting than death...**_**it is ironic that one fears it the more one admires it**_**. i must confess that i admire** _**death's negativity**_**. it is the only thing i can admire and yet not** **love.** _**its grandeur and infinity impress me**_**, but my despair is so vast that i don't even harbor the hope of death. how could i love death?** _**one can only write about it in contradictory ways**_**. whoever says that he knows something definite about death shows that he has not even a** **premonition, although** _**he bears it within himself**_**. every man bears with him not only his life but also his death.”**

**\- “**_**an observation which, to my great regret, is always verifiable: only those are happy who never think or, rather, who only think about life's bare necessities, and to think about such things means not to think at all**_**.** _**true thinking resembles a demon who muddies the spring of life or a sickness which corrupts its roots. to think all the time, to raise questions, to doubt your own destiny, to feel the weariness of living, to be worn out to the point of exhaustion by thoughts and life...**_**” (Ha!)**

**\-** _**“i might become an animal who knows the history of philosophy. as to becoming superman, that**_ _**seems to me utter and ridiculous folly. could there be a solution, approximate of course, in a sort of superconsciousness? couldn't one live beyond (not just on this side, toward animality) all**_ _**complex forms of consciousness, anxiety, agony, in a sphere of life where access to eternity would no longer be pure myth?”**_

**\-** _**“what should i do? work for a social and political system, make a girl miserable? hunt for weaknesses in philosophical systems, fight for moral and esthetic ideals? it's all too little.”**_ **(me- Renunciation)**

_**\- “beyond present-day common ideals and forms, one might breathe in a superconsciousness where the intoxication of eternity would do away with the qualms of this world, and where being would be just as pure and immaterial as nonbeing.”**_

**\- “to live in a bath of fire, transfigured by its rich glow – such is the** _**state of immaterial purity**_ **where one is nothing but a dancing flame. freed from the laws of gravity,** _**life becomes illusion**_ _**or dream.”**_

_**\-**_ **“not everybody loses their innocence: therefore not everybody is unhappy...disintegration implies total loss of innocence, that lovely gift** _**destroyed by knowledge, life's enemy.**_**”**

**\- “innocence is delight in natural charm...there are only two fundamental attitudes: the naive and the heroic...innocence is no longer an option, so there only remains heroism. incapable of fulfillment and happiness... to be a hero - in the most universal sense of the word means to aspire to absolute triumph. but such triumphs come only through death.** _**heroism means transcending life; it is a fatal leap into nothingness**_**, even though the hero may not be aware that his energy springs from a life deprived of its normal supports. all that is innocence, and does not lead to it, belongs to nothingness. can one speak of the seductions of nothingness? if we do, we must add**

**that they are much too mysterious to penetrate.”**

**\- “spirit in life is an anomaly. i have renounced so much, why should i not renounce spirit as well? but besides being an illness of life, is not renunciation first and foremost an illness of**

**the spirit?”**

**\- “i do not know what is right and what is wrong; what is allowed and what is not; i cannot judge and i cannot praise. there are no valid criteria and no consistent principles in the world...it surprises me that some people still concern themselves with a theory of knowledge. to tell the truth, i couldn't care less about the relativity of knowledge, simply because** _**the world does not**_ _**deserve to be known. at times i feel as if i had total knowledge, exhausting the content of this world; at other times the world around me does not make any sense.”**_

_**\- “the feeling of cosmic**_ **loneliness, on the other hand, stems not so much from man's subjective agony as from an awareness of the world's isolation, of objective nothingness. it is as if all the** **splendors of this world were to vanish at once, leaving behind the dull monotony of a cemetery.”**

**\- “how i would love one day to see all people, young and old, sad or happy, men and women, married or not, serious or superficial leave their homes and their work places, relinquish their duties and responsibilities, gather in the streets and** _**refuse to do anything anymore.**_ **at that moment,** **let slaves to senseless work, who have been toiling for future generations under the** _**dire delusion that they contribute to the good of humanity, avenge themselves on the mediocrity of a sterile and insignificant life, on the tremendous waste that never permitted spiritual transfiguration.**_**”** (Karma Yoga, Maya)

**\- “let ideals be declared void; beliefs, trifles; art, a lie; and philosophy, a joke.” (Nihilism, Renunciation)**

**\- “the feeling of utter confusion! not to be able to differentiate, clarify, understand, or appreciate! such a feeling would make any philosopher a poet, but not all philosophers experience it the feeling of utter confusion! not to be able to differentiate, clarify, understand, or appreciate!** _**Such a feeling would make any philosopher a poet, but not all philosophers experience it with significant and durable intensity, for if they did, they could no longer philosophize abstractly and rigidly**_**. How a philosopher becomes a poet is like a drama. you** **fall from a world of abstractions into a whirlwind of feelings, into all the fantastic shapes** **and figures entangled in the soul. how could the actor of a complicated drama of the soul in which, all at once, erotic anticipation clashes with metaphysical anxiety, fear of death with desire for innocence, total renunciation with paradoxical heroism despair with pride, forebodings**

**of madness with longings for anonymity, screams with silence, aspiration with nothingness how** _**could he still go on philosophizing in a systematic way?**_ **There are men who started in the world**

**of abstract forms and ended in absolute confusion. therefore they can only philosophize poetically. in the state of absolute confusion, only the delights and torments of madness still** **matter.”**

**\- “grace is an illusory state in which life negates its antinomies and transcends its demonic dialectic, in which contradictions, fatality, and the consciousness of the irrevocable temporarily vanish...transcending negativity is the essential characteristic of grace.”**

**\- “only sickness gives birth to serious and deep feelings.”**

**\- “he who has not experienced absolute fear, universal anxiety, cannot understand struggle, the madness of the flesh and of death.”**

_**\- “a graceful sense of existence does not lead to metaphysical revelations, to a vision of truth, to the sense of an ending which poisons every moment of life.”**_

**\- “pity is not only inefficient; it is also insulting. and besides, how can you pity another when you** **yourself suffer ignominiously.”**

**\- “even today nobody can tell what is right or what is wrong...since reality is essentially irrational, why set rules, why distinguish the right from the wrong? morality cannot be saved; it's a mistake to believe otherwise.** _**yet there are those who maintain that in this world pleasure and sin are minor satisfactions which enjoy only a brief triumph and that only good deeds partake of**_ _**eternity. they pretend that at the end of this world's misery, goodness and virtue will win but they have failed to see that, if eternity obliterates superficial pleasures, it does the same with virtue, good deeds, and moral actions. eternity does not lead to the triumph of either good or evil; it ravages all.”**_ **(me- Exactly! Ha! Vivekananda- maya, Tillich- doubt as being an intrinsic part of true faith, Kierkegaard and how the infinite scared him, how St. Therese said that thoughts concerning the Infinite brought on even deeper anguish)**

**\- “it is silly to condemn the epicureans in the name of eternity. how is suffering rather than pleasure going to make me immortal? from a purely objective point of view, is there any significant difference between one man's agony and another's pleasure? whether you suffer or not, nothingness will swallow you forever.” (Maya)**

**\- “the experience of eternity therefore depends on intensity of subjective feeling, and the way to eternity is to transcend the temporal...**_**every experience of eternity presupposes a leap and a transfiguration, and few and far between are those capable of the tension necessary to arrive at the blissful contemplation of the eternal.**_**”**

**\- “time with its long train of individual moments is, if not unreal, irrelevant...without temporality, life loses its dramatic character...the experience of the eternity is void of life.”**

**\- “why should i live in history, or worry about the social and cultural problems of the age?**

**i am weary of culture and history; i can no longer bring myself to embrace its torments and its aspirations.** _**We must outstrip history, and we can do so only when past, present, and future cease to be important, when where and when we live becomes a matter of indifference**_**...**_**since there is no hierarchy of life-styles, everybody and nobody is right all at the same time...**_**mankind's achievements could very well be great, but i do not care to know them.** _**I take greater comfort in the contemplation of eternity. in this world not worth so much as a breath, the only valid relation is that between man and eternity, not between man and history.”**_

_**\- “by outstripping history, one acquires superconsciousness, an important ingredient of eternity. it takes you into the realm where contradictions and doubts lose their meaning, where you**_ _**forget about life and death. it is the fear of death that launches men on their quest for eternity...”**_

_**\-**_ **“man tends to monopolize tragedy and suffering in the world: that's why salvation**

**for him is a burning insoluble question. i am not proud to be a man, because i know only too** **well what it is to be man.** _**Only those who have not experienced this state intensely are proud of it, because they intend to become men. their delight is natural: there are among men some who are not far above plants or animals, and therefore aspire to humanity.**_ **but those who know what it means to be man long to be anything but.”**

**\- “magic is useful for small and inessential things, but powerless when confronted with metaphysical reality,** _**which requires, most of the time**_**,** _**silence**_**, something magical sensitivity is incapable of.** _**to live with an acute consciousness of fatality, of one's own impotence in the face of life's great problems, which you cannot even pose without tragically implicating yourself in existence, means to engage directly the capital question of life, that of inaccessible and unknowable infinity.**_**”**

_**\- “you pretend that despair and agony are only preliminaries, that ideally one should overcome them if one is not to become an automaton.**_ **you think joy is the only means of salvation and you despise all others? You call the obsession with agony selfishness and find generous impulses only in joy? you offer us this joy; but how can we receive it from the outside? as long as it does not spring from our inner resources, help from the outside is quite useless. how easy it is to recommend joy to those who cannot be joyful!** _**do all those who are so eager to promote joy realize what it means to feel and fear madness closing in, to live all your life with the tormenting presentiment of madness, to which is added the even more persistent and certain consciousness of death?**_**”**

**\- “let us live the agony fully; let us live our inner tragedy absolutely and frenetically to the very end.”**

**\- “...there is no true or false, only our spontaneous reactions.”**

**\-** _**“isn't intense subjectivity the way to attain universality, exactly as one enters eternity through the instant? men value solitude so little! they condemn the sterility of all that it has produced and give praise exclusively to social values, for they cherish the illusion that they have all contributed to their creation. they all aspire to great achievements through which they hope to attain immortality. as if they will not crumble into dust!”**_ (even Bach will be lost)

**\- “the enthusiast's ability to be constantly reborn raises him above life's demoniacal**

**temptations, the fear of nothingness, and the torments of agony. his life has no tragic dimension, because enthusiasm is the only form of life totally opaque to death. even grace - so similar to enthusiasm- has less of this irrational ignorance of death. grace is full of melancholy charm; not so enthusiasm.** _**my tremendous admiration for enthusiasts stems from my inability to comprehend how there can be such men in a world where death, nothingness, sadness, and despair keep sinister company.**_ **It makes one wonder, to see people who are never desperate.”**

**\- “the enthusiast is preeminently an unproblematic person. he understands many things without ever knowing the agonizing doubts and the chaotic sensitivity of the problematic man. the latter** **cannot solve anything, because nothing satisfies him. you will find in him neither the enthusiast's gift of abandon, his naive irrationality, nor the charming paradox of love in its purest state.”**

**\-** _**“the biblical myth of knowledge as sin is the most profound myth ever invented. the enthusiast's euphoria is due to the fact that he is unaware of the tragedy of knowledge. why not say it? true knowledge is the most tenebrous darkness.”**_

**\- “**_**the height of ecstasy is the final sensation, in which you feel you are dying because of all this light and darkness.**_ **especially weird is the fact that** _**ecstasy wipes out surrounding objects**_**,** _**familiar forms of the world**_**, until ail that is left is a monumental projection of shadow and light.** **it is hard to explain how this selection and purification takes place, why these immaterial shadows hold such sway over us.** _**how can we help attributing an absolute character to light and darkness when they are all that is left of the world's ecstasy?**_ **the frequency with which ecstasy occurs in oriental religions, as well as in other forms of** _**mysticism**_ **at all times, proves the rightness of our hypothesis.** _**the absolute is inside oneself**_**, not outside, and ecstasy, this paroxysm**

**of interiority,** _**reveals only inner shadows and glimmers of light**_**. next to them, the charm of light** **and day fades quickly. ecstasy partakes of essence to such an extent that it gives an impression** **of metaphysical hallucination.** _**pure essences, grasped through ecstasy, are immaterial, but their immateriality causes vertigo and obsession from which you cannot free yourself except by converting them into metaphysical principles.**_**”**

**\- “so you witnessed old age, pain, and death and told yourself that pleasure is an illusion and that the pleasure seekers do not understand the inconstancy of things.** _**then you shunned the world, persuaded that nothing will endure.**_ **"i will not return," you proclaimed, "before i have escaped birth, old age, and death." there is much pride and suffering in every renunciation.** _**instead**_ _**of retreating discreetly, without a big show of revolt and hatred, you denounce, emphatically**_

_**and haughtily, others' ignorance and illusions; you condemn their pleasures**_**. the ascetics, who renounced life and fled into the desert, were convinced that they had overcome all human weaknesses. the belief that they had access to a subjective eternity gave them the illusion of total liberation. nonetheless,** _**their condemnation of pleasure and their contempt for humanity betray their inability to actually free themselves**_**. were i to withdraw into the most fearsome desert, renounce everything, and live in absolute solitude,** _**still I would never dream of despising men and their pleasure. since I cannot really enter eternity through renunciation and solitude, since I shall die like the rest, why despise them, why call my way the only true one? all the great prophets lack discretion and human understanding.**_ **i witness pain, old age, death, and i know that they cannot be overcome; but** _**why should i spoil another's enjoyment with my knowledge? suffering and the consciousness of its in escapability lead to renunciation; yet nothing would induce me, not even if i were to become a leper, to condemn another's joy. there is much envy in every act of condemnation.**_ _**Buddhism and christianity are the revenge and the spite of those who suffer.”**_ **(Ha!)**

_**\-**_ **“the** **thought of renunciation is so bitter that it is hard to imagine how man ever came to**

**conceive of it.** _**he who in a moment of despair has not experienced a cold shiver, a sensation of ineluctable abandonment, cosmic death, and individual nothingness, has not experienced the terrifying preliminaries of renunciation.**_**”**

**\- “not living under the fierce desert sun, with just that one thought about eternity,** _**are we to**_

_**become saints with roofs over our heads?**_**”**

**\- “a world full of philosophers, what a terrifying prospect! they should be all wiped out so that** **life could go on naturally** **– blindly and irrationally.** _**i hate the wisdom of these men unmoved by truths, who do not suffer with their nerves, their flesh, and their blood.**_ **i like only vital, organic truths, the offspring of our anxiety. those whose thoughts are alive are always right; there are no arguments against them. and even if there were, they would not last long. i wonder** **how there can still be men searching for the truth. do wise men not yet understand that truth cannot be?” (Taoism, Sean Carroll and others discussing the multi-verse without any discomfort whatsoever)**

**\- “once you've negated everything and done away completely with all forms of existence, once nothing can survive in the path of your negativity, who can you turn to, laughing or crying, if not** **your own self? once you have witnessed the fall of the entire world, there is nothing left but for you to fall too. the infinite character of irony cancels all of life's contents. i'm not speaking here of elegant, refined irony, born of a sense of superficial pride and superiority - the irony some use to show off their detachment from the world – but of the tragic, bitter irony of despair.** _**genuine irony replaces tears, convulsions, or even a grotesque and criminal grin.”**_

**\- “the essence of social life is injustice.” (me- very Earthly reflections on “poverty”)**

**\- “...infinity, both in time and space, leads to nothing. how can we accomplish anything in the future when we have behind us an eternity in which nothing was accomplished? if the world had had any meaning, it would have been revealed to us by now and we would know it. how can i continue to believe that it will be disclosed in the future when it has not been made manifest yet? but the world has no meaning; irrational at the core, it is, moreover, infinite. meaning is conceivable only in a finite world, where one can reach something, where there are limits to stop**

**our regression, clear points of reference, where history moves toward a goal envisioned**

**by the theory of progress.”**

**\- “to live infinity, as well as to meditate a long time upon it, is the most terrifying lesson**

**in anarchy and revolt one can ever learn.** _**infinity shakes you to the roots of your being, disorganizes you, but it also makes you forget the petty, the contingent, and the insignificant.”**_

_**\- “how fortunate that, having lost all our hopes, we can still leap into infinity, dive into boundlessness, participate in the universal anarchy of its whirlwind!”**_

_**\-**_ **“absolute becoming, infinity destroys anything that is formed, crystallized, or finished. isn't** **music the art which best expresses infinity because it dissolves all forms into a charmingly ineffable fluidity.”**

**\- “i have always wondered why those who have produced masterpieces in these domains have not all gone mad. music more than any other art requires so much concentration that one could easily, after creative moments, lose one's mind. all great composers ought to either commit suicide or become insane at the height of their creative powers. are not all those aspiring to infinity on the road to madness? normality, abnormality, are notions that no longer mean anything. let us live in the ecstasy of infinity, let us love that which is boundless, let us destroy forms...”**

**\-** _**“since i will not die right away, nor regain my innocence, going through the same routine motions every day is sheer madness. banality must be overcome at all costs and the way cleared for transfiguration. how sad to see men bypass themselves, neglect their own destiny instead of rekindling the light they carry within them or getting drunk on their abysmal darkness!”**_ (Tillich, Tolstoy, inward)

**\- “why not abandon this futile work and begin anew without repeating the same wasteful mistake?** _**is subjective consciousness of eternity not enough?**_ **it is the feeling for eternity that the frenetic activity and trepidation of work has destroyed in us. work is the negation of eternity.** _**the more goods we acquire in the temporal realm, the more intense our external work, the less accessible and farther removed is eternity.**_**”**

**\- “**_**hence the limited perspective of active and energetic people, the banality of their thought and actions. i am not contrasting work to either passive contemplation or vague dreaminess, but to an unrealizable transfiguration**_**; nevertheless, i prefer an intelligent and observant laziness to** **intolerable,** _**terrorizing activity**_**. to awaken the modern world, one must praise laziness. the lazy man has an infinitely keener perception of metaphysical reality than the active one.” (me- non-movement, Saints are Conquerors, Underhill thinks Quietism is misconstrued as 'laziness' when in fact it's an undying participation with the Nothingness)**

**\- “sadness, the inebriation and excitement of last moments. is not everything final? what is the anxiety of nothingness if not the perverse joy of our final sadness, our exalted love for the eternity of nothingness and the transience of existence? can it really be that for us existence means exile, and nothingness, home?** _**i must struggle against myself, fly into a rage at my destiny, blow up all**_ _**resistance to my transfiguration; let there be only my desire for light and darkness!**_ **let each one of my actions be either triumph or fall, flight or failure! let life grow and die in me with the speed of a lightning bolt!** _**let not the pettiness and rationality of commonplace existence spoil the pleasures and torments of my inner chaos, the tragic delights of my final despair and joy!”**_

_**\- “when men can no longer bear the monotony and the banality of ordinary existence, they will find in each experience of the absolute an opportunity to commit suicide.**_ **the impossibility** **of surviving such extraordinary states of exaltation will destroy existence. no one will then doubt that it is possible to long for death after having listened to certain symphonies or admired a unique landscape.”**

**\- “ To speak of suffering as the path to love means to know nothing of suffering's satanic essence.** _**you don't climb up the steps of suffering; you climb down. they do not lead to heaven but to hell. the darkness at the bottom of the ladder of suffering is less eternal or infinite than the blinding light at the top of the ladder of joy.**_**”**

_**\- “disjunction from the world through suffering leads to excessive interiorization and, paradoxically, to such a high level of consciousness that the world, with all its splendors and glooms, becomes exterior and transcendent.”**_ **(me- pantheistic paradox)**

_**\-**_ **“...however painful my agony, however great my isolation, the distance separating me from the world does nothing but render it more accessible.”**

**\- “there's no salvation without the immediate. but man is a being who no longer knows the immediate.” (me- Jesus and anxiety about tomorrow, says think about today. Buddha talks about the present moment, etc)**

**\-** _**“when we have persuaded ourselves that there is no truth. all salvation comes thenceforth,**_

_**even salvation through nothing.”**_

**\- “for those deprived of faith, an excess of subjectivity leads either to megalomania or self-denigration, to too much love or too much self-hatred. Either way, you spend yourself ahead of time. subjectivity makes you either god or satan.”**

**\- “man should stop being- or becoming - a rational animal. he should become a lunatic, risking everything for the sake of his dangerous fantasies, capable of exaltations, ready to die for all** **that the world has as well as for what it has not. each man's ideal should be to stop being a man. this can only be attained through absolute arbitrariness.”**

**\-** _**“nothing matters. everything is possible, and yet nothing is. all is permitted, and yet again, nothing. no matter which way we go, it is no better than any other. it is all the same whether you**_ _**achieve something or not, have faith or not, just as it is all the same whether you cry or remain**_ _**silent. there is an explanation for everything, and yet there is none. everything is both real and**_ _**unreal, normal and absurd, splendid and insipid. there is nothing worth more than anything else, nor any idea better than any other. why grow sad from one's sadness and delight**_ _**in one's joy? What does it matter whether our tears come from pleasure or pain? love your unhappiness and hate your happiness, mix everything up, scramble it all! be a snowflake dancing**_ _**in the air, a flower floating downstream! have courage when you don't need to, and be a coward**_ _**when you must be brave! who knows? you may still be a winner! and if you lose, does it really matter? is there anything to win in this world? all gain is a loss, and all loss is a gain. why always expect a definite stance, clear ideas, meaningful words?”**_

_**\- “**_**all efforts to attain happiness, on the other hand, are entirely futile.** _**you can not retrace your steps once you've taken the path to unhappiness**_**;** _**it is the path of no return**_**. from being happy, one can become unhappy, so there are more unpleasant surprises in happiness than in unhappiness. the world seems right to us when we are happy; when unhappy, we wish the world were anything but what it is. though fully aware that the source of unhappiness is in us, we nevertheless turn a personal defect into a metaphysical deficiency.”**

**\- “why do men insist on achieving something? Would it not be better if they stood still under the sun in calm and silent immobility? what is there to accomplish? why so much effort and ambition? man has forgotten the meaning of silence.”**

**\- “could morality still serve such a being-** _**probably the most generous because also the most absurd, capable of renouncing the whole world, and consequently giving away all that can be**_ _**given?**_ **generosity is incompatible with morality, that rationalization of customs, that mechanization of life.** _**Any generous act is absurd, a renunciation unheard of in the**_

_**ordinary man, who drapes himself in morality in order to hide his vulgar nullity.**_ **all that is truly moral begins when we have done with morality. the pettiness of its laws is never more evident than in its condemnation of vice, the expression of carnal tragedy born from the presence of the spirit in the flesh. vice is the tragedy of the flesh, the flesh bursting out of its own fatality, attempting to break the shackles imprisoning its passionate impulses.”**

_**\- “then you will think it useless to express an opinion, to take a stand, to make an impression; the noises you have renounced increase the anxiety of your soul. after having struggled madly to solve all problems, after having suffered on the heights of despair, in the supreme hour of revelation, you will find that the only answer, the only reality, is silence.”**_ **(in 'nothing matters' he describes the Absurd Perspective that turns all and any action nonsensical. He also refers to being saved from acting like just another 'clown' through silence)**

**\- “a little knowledge is delightful; a lot, disgusting. the more you know, the less you want to know. he who has not suffered from knowledge has never known anything.”**

**\- “fine psychological understanding is the product of a life of self-contemplation, a life which** **sees itself in other lives as if in so many mirrors; for a psychologist, all men are fragments of himself...quickly exhausting men and their limited resources, the psychologist is easily bored, for he is not naive enough to have friends and is too self-conscious to have lovers.”**

**\- “time...becomes an ever-growing nothingness, a dilating void,** _**a threat from beyond**_**.”** 

(The Premonition of Madness- Cioran describes “ego-death” which is always said to be one of the most, if not the most, important parts of an experience of the Other, in exactly the same way as Eckhart, John of the Cross, Augustine, Luther, etc., but then goes on to describe the Nihilistic experience, which is the religious experience, as “madness”. What kind of culture would allow a 22 year old to conceive of such a terrifying experience as this to be “madness” in a pejorative sense? Jesus said the path was narrow! The Nihilistic experience is madness, but it is also God.)

_**\- “History is the obstacle to ultimate revelation, the shackle we can strike off only if we have perceived the nullity of every event except the one that this very perception represents, and thanks to which we attain at moments to “the real truth,” i.e., to the victory over all truths.”**_

_**\-**_ **“To escape our fate— what is the good of striving for that? Not that we must despair of finding a substitute ending. Yet it must be a likely one, one that has some chance of being realized. Man being what he is,** _**can we admit that he might be granted the opportunity of subsiding in the peace of decay, amid the benefits of decrepitude?**_**” (me- Tillich: the meaning of life is to despair over the meaninglessness of life)**

**\- “The abyss is in ourselves and outside of ourselves, it is yesterday’s presentiment, today’s question, tomorrow’s certainty.” (me- The Kingdom of God is Within You, turn inward, Vivekananda, renouncing, selflessness)**

**\- “Since in us has awakened the evil that slumbered in the remainder of the living, it remains for us to destroy ourselves so that they might be saved.” (me- selflessness, self-abnegation)**

**\- “And the gods— have we not turned against them as well, outraged to see that they were conscious without suffering from the fact, while for us consciousness and shipwreck are one and the same thing?” (me- rejecting the idea of a personal God. Another tenant of the Nihilistic Mystical experience.)**

**\-** _**“At the climax of our Void, we will be doomed, then, to the indignity of a complete erosion, worse than a sudden catastrophe which would be honorable after all, even glamorous. Let us be confident, let us put our bets on catastrophe, more in accord with our genius and our tastes. Let us take one step further, let us suppose it to be upon us, let us treat it as a fail accompli. According to all appearances, it will include certain survivors, a few lucky ones who will have had the good fortune to contemplate its occurrence and to draw lessons from it. Their first concern will certainly be to abolish the memory of the old humanity, of all the enterprises that have discredited and destroyed it. Turning against the cities, they will seek to complete their ruin, to erase all traces of them. One rachitic tree will be worth more in their eyes than a museum or a temple. No more schools; on the other hand, courses in oblivion and unlearning to celebrate the virtues of inattention and the delights of amnesia. The disgust inspired by the sight of any book, frivolous or serious, will extend to all Knowledge, which will be referred to with embarrassment or dread as if it were an obscenity or a scourge. To bother with philosophy, to elaborate a system, to attach oneself to it and believe in it, will appear as an impiety, a provocation, and a betrayal, a criminal complicity with the past.”**_ **(me- maybe stop writing 'me'? Vivekananda- 'good to be born in church, but not die in a church, 'lack of spiritual progression', Unity in different sects, perennialism, reject literalism)**

**\- “**_**It is doubtless distressing that we must confront the final phase of the historical process at the moment when, having liquidated our old beliefs, we lack any metaphysical assets, any substantial reserves of the Absolute. Surprised by the death agony, dispossessed of everything, we skirt that flattering nightmare experienced by all who had the privilege of finding themselves at the heart of a conspicuous débâcle. If, with the courage to look things in the face, we had that of suspending our course, if only for an instant, this respite, this pause on a global scale, would suffice to reveal to us the nature of the precipice over which we hang, and the resulting dread would quickly be converted into prayers or lamentations, into a salutary convulsion.”**_

_**\- “**_**What advantage would having faith be to me, since I understand Meister Eckhart just as well without it?”**

**\- “Friendship being incompatible with truth, only the mute dialogue with our enemies is fruitful.”**

**\- “I would not want to live in a world drained of all religious feeling. I am not thinking of faith but of that inner vibration which, independent of any belief in particular, projects you into, and sometimes above God.”**

**\- “If the narrative of the Fall is so striking, it is because its author describes neither entities nor symbols: he sees a God strolling in a garden, a rural God, as one exegete has so accurately characterized Him.”**

_**\- “To detest someone is to want him to be anything but what he is. T. writes me that I am the man he loves most in the world . . . but he urges me at the same time to forgo my obsessions, to change my ways, to become different, to break with the man I am. Which is to say that he rejects my being.”**_

**\- “What a pity that “nothingness” has been devalued by an abuse of it made by philosophers unworthy of it!”**

**\- “Whoever speaks the language of utopia is more alien to me than a reptile from another geological era.”**

**\- “A Tantric ritual: during the initiation ceremony, you are given a mirror in which you see your own image. Contemplating it, you realize you are nothing but that, i.e., nothing. To what end, so many pretenses, so many airs and graces, when it is so easy to comprehend one’s insignificance?”**

**\- “Plotinus experienced only four moments of ecstasy; Ramana Maharshi, but one. What does the number matter! If anyone is to be pitied, it is the man who has never had even an inkling of such things, and who speaks of them from hearsay.”**

**\- “**_**To be**_ **is to be cornered.”**

**\- “In flawed families, a scion appears who dedicates himself to the truth and who ruins himself in its pursuit.”**

**\- “**_**Once one has understood, it would be best to drop dead on the spot. What is to understand? What we have really grasped cannot be expressed in any way at all, and cannot be transmitted to anyone else, not even to oneself, so that we die without knowing the exact nature of our own secret.”**_

_**\-**_ **“One is and remains a slave as long as one is not cured of hoping.”**

**\- “When I see someone fighting for some cause or other, I try to know what is happening in his mind and what can be the source of his obvious lack of maturity. The rejection of resignation is perhaps a sign of “life,” never in any case of perspicacity or simply of reflexion. The sane man never lowers himself to protest. He scarcely consents to indignation.** _**Taking human affairs seriously attests to some secret flaw.”**_

_**\-**_ **“I do not struggle against the world, I struggle against a greater force, against my weariness of the world.”**

**\- “I have less and less discernment as to what is good and what evil. When I make no distinction whatever between the two, supposing I reach this point some day— what a step forward! Toward what?”**

**\- “Get hold of yourself, be confident once more, don’t forget that it is not given to just anyone to have idolized discouragement without succumbing to it.” (Ha!)**

**\- “The further one advances into age, the more one runs after honors. Perhaps, in fact, vanity is never more active than on the brink of the grave. One clings to trifles in order not to realize what they conceal, one deceives nothingness by something even more null and void.”**

**\- “To try curing someone of a “vice,” of what is the deepest thing he has, is to attack his very being, and indeed this is how he himself understands it, since he will never forgive you for wanting him to destroy himself in your way and not in his.”**

**\- “The apparition of life? A temporary madness, a prank, a whim of the elements, a vagary of matter. The only ones entitled to grumble are the individual beings, pitiable victims of a passing fancy.”**

**\- “The only profound thinkers are the ones who do not suffer from a sense of the ridiculous.”**

**\- “In my childhood, a profound shock when I heard my father, back from the cemetery, tell how a young mother who had lost her baby daughter burst out laughing at the moment the coffin was lowered into the grave. Fit of madness? Yes and no. For when we attend a funeral and the absolute deception is suddenly unmasked, do we not have a craving to react precisely like that mother? It is too much****— it is almost a provocation: nature exaggerates. We conceive that we might collapse in hilarity.”**

**\- “**_**We are all of us in error**_**, the humorists excepted. They alone have discerned, as though in jest, the inanity of all that is serious and even of all that is frivolous.” (me- symbolism, finite/infinite distinction)**

**\- “I abide by appearances, I note what they are and adhere to them only to the degree that, as a living being, I cannot do otherwise. I act like other people, I perform the same deeds they do, but I identify myself with neither my words nor my actions, I bow to customs and laws, I pretend to share the convictions, i.e., the prejudices, of my fellow citizens, while knowing that in the last analysis I am quite as unreal as they. What then is the skeptic?** **—A ghost: a conformist ghost.”**

**\- “**_**Life is more and less than boredom, though it is in boredom and by boredom that we discern what life is worth. Once boredom insinuates itself into you, once you fall under its invisible hegemony, everything else seems insignificant. The same might be said of suffering. Yes, indeed. But suffering is localized, whereas boredom evokes an evil without site or support, only that indefinable nothing that erodes you . . . A pure erosion, whose imperceptible effect slowly transforms you into a ruin unnoticed by others and almost unnoticed by yourself.”**_ (Tillich)

_**\-**_ **“To die at sixty or at eighty is harder than at ten or at thirty. Habituation to life, there’s the rub. For life is a vice— the greatest one of all. Which explains why we have so much difficulty ridding ourselves of it.”**

_**\- “When I happen to be satisfied with everything, even with God and myself, I immediately react like the man who, on a brilliant day, torments himself because the sun is bound to explode in a few billion years.”**_

**\- “Of two enemies at odds, it is unlikely that only one should be in the right. When we listen to them one after the other, we yield, if we are in good faith, to the arguments of each, at the risk of looking like a weathercock, of being, in short, too much of a philosopher.”**

_**\- “What is evil? It is what is done with a view to happiness in this world.”**_

_**\-**_ **“Everything is nothing, including the consciousness of nothing.”**

**\- “Everything that happens is at once natural and inconceivable. This conclusion is unavoidable, whether we consider great or trivial events.”**

**\- “**_**Everything I have ventured, everything I have held forth on all my life is indissociable from what I have experienced. I have invented nothing, I have merely been the secretary of my sensations.”**_

_**\- “We can conceive of eternity only by eliminating all the perishable, all that counts for us. Eternity is absence, being that fills none of the functions of being; it is privation erected into . . . something or other, hence it is nothing or, at most, an estimable fiction.”**_ **(amazing! God is Nothing!)**

**\- “Undeniable sign of spiritual nonfulfillment: every passionate reaction to blame, that twinge at the heart whenever we are reproached in one way or another. This is the cry of the old Adam in each of us, it proves we have not yet conquered our origins. So long as we do not aspire to be scorned, we are like the others, like those precisely whom we scorn.”**

**\- “X, who instead of looking at things directly has spent his life juggling with concepts and abusing abstract terms, now that he must envisage his own death, is in desperate straits. Fortunately for him, he flings himself, as is his custom, into abstractions, into commonplaces illustrated by jargon. A glamorous hocus-pocus, such is philosophy. But ultimately, everything is hocus-pocus, except for this very assertion that participates in an order of propositions one dares not question because they emanate from an unverifiable certitude, one somehow anterior to the brain’s career.”**

**\- “It makes no sense to say that death is the goal of life. But what else is there to say?”**

**\- “**_**We regret not having had the courage to make such and such a decision; we regret much more having made one— any one. Better no action than the consequences of an action!”**_

**\- “All things considered, philosophy is not so contemptible: to hide oneself under more or less objective truths, to disclose oppressions that apparently do not concern us, to cultivate faceless dreads, to camouflage calls for help by the splendors of language . . . Philosophy? An anonymous cry...”**

**\- “Everyone is mistaken, everyone lives in illusion. At best, we can admit a scale of fictions, a hierarchy of unrealities, giving preference to one rather than to another; but to choose, no, definitely not that...”** (me- Vivekananda, Tillich, Symbolism, Becker)

**\- “Boredom, which seems to search out everything to its root, actually searches out nothing, because it descends only into itself and sounds only its own void.”**

**\-** _**“As soon as one returns to Doubt (if it could be said that one has ever left it), undertaking anything at all seems not so much useless as extravagant. No joyful companion, Doubt works deep within you like a disease or, even more effectively, like a faith.”**_ **(me- Tillich exactly, pg. 25 dynamics of faith)**

**\- “To that friend who tells me he is bored because he cannot work, I answer that boredom is a higher state, and that we debase it by relating it to the notion of work.”**

**\- “Get hold of yourself, be confident once more, don’t forget that it is not given to just anyone to have** _**idolized discouragement**_ **without succumbing to it.” (me- Vivekananda)**

**\- “After all, why should ordinary people want to contemplate the End, especially when we see the condition of those who do?” (Ha! Bad PR)**

**\- “Only the perception of the Void allows us to triumph over death. For if everything lacks reality, why should death be allowed it?”**

**\- “A terrible yet endurable mortification: to be born among a people that will never be mentioned.”**

# **_The Trouble With Being Born_**

**\- “The further men get from God, the farther they advance into the knowledge of religions.”**

**\- “Existence = Torment. The equation seems obvious to me, but not to one of my friends. How to convince them? I cannot** _**lend**_ **him my sensations; yet only they would have the power to persuade him, to give him that additional dose of** _**ill-being**_ **he has so insistently asked for all this time.”**

**\- “The West: a sweet-smelling rottenness, a perfumed corpse.”**

**\- “...Do we think of Buddha withdrawing from the world** _**on account of his contemporaries?”**_

**\- “Life would become endurable only among a humanity which no longer have any illusions in reserve, a humanity completely disabused and** _**delighted**_ **to be so.”**

**\- “Life is nothing; death, everything. Yet there** _**is**_ **nothing which is death, independent of life. It is precisely this absence of autonomous, distinct reality which makes death universal; it has no realm of its own, it is omnipresent, like everything which lacks identity, limit, and bearing; an indecent infinitude.” (me- A Pessimist's description of God)**

**\- “When someone complains that his life has come to nothing, we need merely remind him that life itself is an analogous situation, if not worse.”**

**\- “The perception of the Precarious raised to the level of vision, of mystical experience.”**

**\- “Explosive force of any mortification. Every vanquished desire affords us power. We have the more hold over this world the further we withdraw from it, the less we adhere to it.** _**Renunciation confers an infinite power**_**.”**

**\- “'All is suffering' – modernized, the Buddhist expression runs: 'All is nightmare.'”**

<br>

### **_The Undelivered_** **_(within_** **_The New Gods_****_)_**

**\- “The void allows us to erode the idea of being; but it is not drawn into this erosion itself; it survives an attack which would be self-destructive for any other idea.” (me- God)**  

_**\- “And to understand signifies to discern the degree of awakening to which a being has achieved, in his capacity to perceive the sum of unreality which enters into each phenomenon.”**_ **(me- can you imagine the thing you find most valuable in this world as worthless? Can you imagine your most cherished anything as meaningless?)**

**\- “Beatitude is not compatible with this world. It is for beatitude that the hermit cuts all his moorings, for beatitude that he destroys himself.” (me- Maya)**

**\- “All our beliefs being intrinsically superficial and governing only appearances, it follows that all are on the same level, at the same degree of unreality.” (me- limitations of language, the need for symbolism and myth, religious pluralism, anti-literalism, etc.)**

**\- “Every day we should honor someone, creature or object, by renouncing them.”**

**\- “The void is nothingness stripped of its negative qualifications, nothingness transfigured. If we should manage to develop a taste for it, our relations with the world are transformed; something in us changes, though we keep our old defects. But we are no longer from** _**here**_ **in the same way as before.”**

_**\- “How desist from what we shall never recover, from that pathetic and unheard of nothing which bears our name...we can vanquish it only by means of a sudden whirlwind which, sweeping away the ego, leaves us alone, without anyone, without ourselves...”**_ **(me- awakening to the truth of selflessness, that all is one, unity through complete and utter renunciation and self-abnegation, psychedelics)**

**\- “Thought, too, is a prejudice, a shackle. It liberates only at the beginning, when it permits us to break certain moorings; afterwards, all it is capable of is to adsorb our energy and to paralyze our impulses toward liberation.”**

**\- “**_**We cling to anything, if only we don't have to tear ourselves away from that fascination accountable for our actions and even our nature, from that primal dazzle which keeps us from discerning the nonreality in everything.”**_

_**\-**_ **“The void- myself without me- is the liquidation of the adventure of the 'I'- it is being without any trace of being, a blessed engulfment, an incomparable disaster.”** (psychedelics, psylocibin)

**\- “All the same it seems inconceivable for us once we consider the self coldly; it crumbles, it vanishes, it is nothing more than the symbol of a fiction.”**

**\- “Even the Buddha after illumination was only Siddhartha Gautama** _**with knowledge in addition.”**_ **(Mckenna 'no one knows what's going on here')**

_**\- “To find that everything lacks reality and not to put an end to it all, this inconsistency is not an inconsistency at all: taken to extremes, the perception of the void coincides with the perception of the whole, with the entrance into the All.”**_

**\-** _**“Even if the experience of the void were only a deception, it would still deserve to be tried. What it proposes, what it attempts, is to reduce to nothing both life and death, and this with the sole intention of making them endurable to us.”**_

<br>

### _**Dealing with the Mystics**_ **(within** _**The Temptation to Exist**_**)**

**\- “It is a mistake to supposed that mysticism derives from a softening of the instincts, from a compromised vitality...To get a sense of them, imagine a Hernando Cortez in the middle of an invisible geography. The German mystics were conquerors too.”** (participation, this is hard work)

<br>

# _**Tears and Saints**_

_**\- “All great conversions are born from the sudden revelation of life's meaninglessness. Nothing could be more impressive than this sudden apprehension of the void of existence.”**_

_**\- “The initial revelation of any monastery: everything is nothing. Thus begin all mysticisms. It is less than one step from nothing to God, for God is the positive expression of nothingness.”**_

_**\- “Without God, everything is nothingness. But God is the supreme nothingness!”**_

_**\- “No matter how educated you are, if you don't think intensely about death, you are a mere fool. A great scholar – if he is nothing but that**_ _**– is inferior to an illiterate peasant haunted by final questions. Generally speaking, science has dulled people's minds by diminishing their metaphysical consciousness.”**_

**\- “If you believe in God, you are mad without having gone mad.” (ha! It's not about 'belief', but experience, one must go 'mad' for God, e.g. Vivekananda's example of holding the head under water, become a 'God-intoxicated man, embracing the Nothingness, become the bible/don't just read the bible)**

**\- “God's greatest advantage is that one can say or think anything about him. The less you connect your thoughts, abandoning them to contradictions, the more you risk coming near the truth. God benefits from the peripheries of logic.” (symbolism, anti-literalism)**

**\- “He who does not think of God will forever remain a stranger to himself. God is self-knowledge, and universal history is a description of his various forms.”**

**\-** _**“Since nothing has real substance, and life is a twirl in the void, its beginning and its end are meaningless.” (Vivekananda, Maya)**_

**\- “Only by thinking about him constantly and mercilessly, only by setting siege to his solitude can we win rich spoils in our battle with him. If we lose heart and go halfway only, he will just be one more failure.” (participation, Tillich, Tolstoy and the need for a change in one's life)**

**\- “Theology is the negation of divinity. Looking for proofs of God is crazy idea...theology is the atheist's mode of believing. The most obscure mystical mumbo-jumbo is closer to God than the** _**Summa Theologiae.”**_ **(symbolism, infinite/finite gap, direct experience over mere belief, ritual, dogma, etc.)**

**\- “I am sorry sometimes that God no longer fills us with dread. If only we could feel again the primordial quiver of dread in front of the unknown!” (psychedelics)**

**\- “Religion is a smile masking cosmic nonsense, one last waft of perfume drifting over nothingness.”**

**\-** _**“Bach's music is the medium of heavenly transfiguration.”**_

_**\- “Wine has brought men closer to God than theology.”**_

**\-** _**“When we have devoured the world and remain alone, God appears from behind the screen of Nothingness like a last temptation.”**_ (Vivekananda, when you are no longer satisfied with covering up the wound)

**\- “...we no longer know how to prepare ourselves for death. No one cultivates death** _**in**_ **himself any longer, it happens** _**over**_ **and** _**above**_ **him.” (Vivekananda, Tolstoy)**

_**\- “For an ancient philosopher or a medieval monk, 'there is no way out' would make a constant theme for meditation.”**_

_**\-**_ **“God's greatest advantage is that one can say or think anything about him. The less you connect your thoughts, abandoning them to contradictions, the more you risk coming near the truth. God benefits from the peripheries of logic.” (symbolism)**

**\- “...Bach often meditated on death...Handel compared to Bach, is** _**of this world.**_ **Bach is** _**divine...”**_

**\- “Saintly meditation is an imprisonment in original memory.” (Plato, recollection)**

**\- “Why do almost all madmen speak of God or believe themselves to be one? Having lost the actual contents of their memory, their mind has kept intact the original depths of memory.”**

**\- “The organ is an instrument which makes palpable God's distance from us.” (ha!)**

**\- “We are all subject to death at any moment.” (Pascal)**

**\- “There comes a moment in life when one places everything in relation to God. Anything less seems too little. Yet the fear that God may no longer be topical sometimes grabs you, and relating everything to him seems useless. The transience of the ultimate principle – a logically absurd idea, yet present in consciousness** **– fills you with strange terror. Could God be just a fashion of the soul, a fleeting passion of history?” (Vivekananda, Tolstoy, doubt as** _**part**_ **of faith)**

**\- “The more time has disappeared from one's memory, the closer one is to mysticism. Paradise is not possible without a defective memory. The healthier the memory is, the more it adheres to the world.”**

**\-** _**“Compared to philosophers, saints know nothing. Yet they know everything. Compared to Aristotle, any saint is illiterate. What makes us then believe that we might learn more from the latter? Because all of the philosophers put together are not worth a single saint. Philosophy has no answers. Compared to philosophy, saintliness is an exact science. It gives us precise answers to questions that philosophers do not even dare consider. Its method is suffering and its goal is God.”**_

_**\-**_ **“In itself, philosophy, life the rest of culture, is nothing.”**

**\- “A philosopher is saved from mediocrity either through skepticism or mysticism,** _**the two forms of despair in front of knowledge.**_ **Mysticism is an escape from knowledge, and skepticism is knowledge without hope. In either instance, the world is** _**not**_ **a solution.”**

**\- “Saints are completely out-of-date.” (ha!)**

**\-** _**“Without my solitude I would be nothing but another clown.”**_ (Quietism, non-movement, the absurdity of action, silence, renunciation, 9/13- how I am acting with Hattie with my outward actions and outburtsts, blah)

**\- “When the void of time gives birth to eternity, one burns with religious courage. The emptying of time, whether out of boredom or dread, throws one into a vibrant nothingness, full of vague promises. No saint could find eternity in the world.”**

**\- “**_**Saintliness is a negative sort of perfection...**_**There are illnesses that can only be treated with a good dose of divinity, but I prefer the alleviation of pain provided by earthly tranquilizers.” (Ha!)**

**\- “God nestles in spiritual voids.”**

**\- “Saintliness cannot exist without the voluptuousness of pain and a perverse refinement of suffering.”**

**\-** _**“Nothing can reveal divinity better than the inner multiplication, through memory, of a Bach fugue.”**_

**\- “Mysticism revolves around the passion for ecstasy and a horror of the void. One cannot know one without the other...Once it has totally rejected the world, the soul is ripe for a long-term and fecund** _**emptiness…**_**One sees nothing except** _**nothingness.**_ **And the latter has become** _**everything.**_ **Ecstasy is plenitude in a void, a** _**full void**_**. It is an overwhelming frisson which convulses nothingness, an invasion of** _**being**_ **in absolute emptiness.” (incredible description of Nihilism)**

**\- “The 'appetite for God'...is first a negation of existence...'appetite for God' can only be a symptom of nihilism. Its intensity proves to what extent one no longer belongs to this earth. One betrays a deficiency of vital instincts whenever one thinks instinctively about God.”**

_**\- “All nihilists have wrestled with God. One more proof of his kinship with nothingness After you have trampled everything under foot, his is the last bastion of nothingness left.”**_

_**\-**_ **“Each time weariness with the world takes on a religious form, God appears like a sea of forgetfulness. Drowning in God is a refuge from our own individuality.”**

_**\- “As long as you are busy with him you have an excuse for sadness and solitude. God? An official madness.”**_ **(Ha! Too funny)**

**\- “**_**Listening to Bach, one sees God come into being. His music generates divinity. After a Bach...one feels that God must exists. Otherwise, Bach's music would be only heartrending illusion. Theologians and philosophers wasted so many days and nights searching for proofs of his existence, ignoring the only valid one: Bach.”**_ **(agreed)**

_**\-**_ **“The more you think of God, the less you are. Thus God is nothing more than the projection of our longing for annihilation.”**

**\- “Healthy bodies and healthy minds have never been shaken by religious fears.”**

**\- “The failed mystic is the one who cannot cast off all temporal ties.”**

**\- “**_**The last step towards nihilism is the disappearance into divinity.”**_

**\- “Life is a series of obsessions that one must do away with.”**

**\- “**_**Man is a paradox of nature, equally removed from it and from God...With it (consciousness), God appeared in his true light as one more nothingness.”**_

_**\-**_ **“Religion is a smile masking cosmic nonsense, one last waft of perfume drifting over nothingness.”**

**\-** _**“To have faith one must remain passive vis-a-vis the world. The believer must not do anything.”**_ **(non-movement, Quietism, Vivekananda/Karma/Jnana Yoga7)**

**\- “Disagreement is a sign of spiritual vitality. It culminates in disagreement with God.” (Vivekananda, multiple sects, limits of language, symbolism)**

**\- “The obsession with God dislodges earthly love.”**

**\- “I have always wondered about people who are 'crazy for God,' who have sacrificed everything for him, first of all their minds.”**

**\- “Thinking is not exhaustive; there are infinite variations on the theme of God.”**

**\- “Intimations of God's supreme indifference render man's revolt utterly pointless. To be a hero only in the eyes of men is a paltry thing. There is no consolation in dying like a hero, i.e. misunderstood by the gods.”**

**\-** _**“There are many thinkers and dreamers who never feel the need for God. Sadness without the need for consolation does not guarantee a religious experience. Those limited to sadness per se are strangers to God. The absolute is a specific tonality of sadness.”**_ **(this would make sense of the different levels of awareness, the different levels of the Nihilistic experience)**

**\-** _**“...how do you fill out an empty life? With women, books, or worldly ambitions? No matter what you do, the starting point is boredom, and the end self-destruction.**_**” (suicide)**

**\- “The task of a solitary man is to be even more solitary.”**

**\- “Any kind of boredom will reveal two things to us: our bodies and the nothingness of the world.”**

**\- “God...is he anything but the fateful moment when our life totters on the brink of destruction?”**

**\- “Churches are undercover hospices.”**

**\- “An anxiety born out of nothing suddenly grows in us and confirms our homelessness.” (Tillich, Vivekananda)**

**\- “Only ecstasy cures us of pessimism. Life would be unbearable if it were real. As a dream, it is a mixture of charm and terror to which we gladly abandon ourselves. Consciousness is nature's nightmare.” (Vivekananda mixed with Zapffe)**

**\-** _**“The company of mortals is, for a lucid man, pure torture.”**_ **(Ha!)**

**\-** _**“I live on what makes other people die”**_ **(quoting Michelangelo)**

**\- “To be alone, horribly alone, is the only imperative, and it must be obeyed at any price.”**

**\- “...life is an uninterrupted religious crisis, superficial for believers and shattering for doubters**_**.”**_

_**\- “The ultimate goal of all religions: life as a diminution of the soul.” (and on the other end) “All that if Life in me urges me to give up God.” ('the divided self', Karma Yoga, Tolstoy, Augustine)**_

**\- “The fall** **– emblem of our human condition – is a nervous exacerbation of consciousness.”**

**\- “All that adheres to this world is trivial.”**

**\- “Let God pray for the man in whom there is nothing left to die!” (uninterrupted religious crisis, infinite/finite gap that's unbridgeable)**

**\- “Voluntary hunger is a road to heaven; hunger from poverty, a crime of the earth.”**

**\- “Detachment is a negation of both life and death. Whoever has overcome his fear of death has also triumphed over life. For life is nothing but another word for this fear.”**

**\- “When I realized there was no absolute except in renunciation, I dedicated myself to appearances.” (bars, extreme lifestyle, maya, etc.)**

**\-** _**“Nothing is more exquisite or more disturbing than to have the thought of God occur while one lies in the arms of a whore! It is easy to think of him after a page from the Bible or after an oratorio, but God's presence manifested in the midst of vulgar debauchery has an infinitely greater impact: it brings loneliness and the dread of nothingness back to mind with full force.”**_ **(Yes! Extreme lifestyle, always being aware even in situations that are supposedly distractions)**

**\- “It may very well be that man's sole purpose is none other than to** _**think**_ **of God...It is only by thinking of him that God makes one feel uncomfortable. Start prying into him and you are lost...God is an old frumpy coat which you must put on if you have nothing better to wear.”**

**\- “To doubt God is to be self-ironical.”**

**\- “Sometimes God is so easy to make out that just listening a bit more carefully to one's inner voice is enough.”**

**\- “**_**Spirit**_ **means renunciation...when people, not having experienced spiritual torture, satisfy their thirst for renunciation through a derivative: heroism.”** (Ha! The worldly aspects of religion, atheism, etc. if there is no direct experience of everything being nothing, then you are left with delusions without the awareness that all are delusions, i.e. symbolism)

**\- “**_**Intimations of God's supreme indifference render man's revolt utterly pointless. To be a hero only in the eyes of men is a paltry thing.**_ **There is no consolation in dying like a hero, i.e., misunderstood by the gods.”**

**\- “The more bored one is, the more self-conscious.”**

_**\- “...a sort of terminal emotion seizes us. We can talk for hours on end with people we despise, we can say happy and irrelevant things without their noticing how close we are to the Last Judgment, and how lost we are to the world!” (my job/life)**_

**\- “Boredom is the only argument against immortality. From it derive all our negations.”**

**\- “**_**When nothing is left standing, one experiences exciting power thrills.**_ **The ironic mode is a ruse of self-importance: to make up for its nonexistence, the 'I' becomes everything.” (Ha! Desperation to the earthly)**

**\- “Life is a reality only for wholesome people, high priests of stupidity!” (Ha!)**

**\-** _**“We are not when we are one with the world. Our desire to escape the world and thus be ourselves sends us on a quest for suffering. Asceticism is the paroxysm of such desire, a systematic insomnia and starvation. Self-torture intensifies subjectivity...Once you have tasted the joys of suffering, you are hooked on them for ever.”**_

_**\- “There is so much knowledge in melancholy that we call it a vice.”**_

**\- “When you become prey to an incurable boredom, illness seems a welcome distraction.”**

**\- “..detachment from worldly things, a precondition for attachment to God.”**

**\- “Only ecstasy cures us of pessimism. Life would be unbearable if it were real. As a dream, it is a mixture of charm and terror to which we gladly abandon ourselves. Consciousness is nature's nightmare.” (Ha! Vivekananda)**

**\- “The course of meditation: you begin by ignoring the object and end by ignoring the world.”**

**\- “As long as I live I shall not allow myself to forget that I shall die...”**

**\- “While reading subtle and useless philosophical polemics at the library, an irresistible longing for the desolation of deserts would sometimes grab hold of me.”**

**\- “I think of Man and see only shadows; I think of shadows and see only myself.”**

**\- “Man either loses himself in God or taunts him, but no one has ever remained level-headed in his presence.”**

**\-** _**“All that is Life in me urges me to give up God.”**_ (THE contradiction)

**\- “If you don't take an interest in him, you end up interested in mankind. Could you fall any lower than that?” (Ha!)**

**\- “The dead center of existence: when it is all the same to you whether you read a newspaper article or think of God.”**

**\- “Despair and pride grow so closely together that even the keenest observer cannot tell them apart.”**

**\- “Truly, everything can be used as argument for or against him, because everything in the world both confirms and denies his divinity. Blasphemy and prayer are both justified.”**

**\- “The fall** **– emblem of our human condition – is a nervous exacerbation of consciousness.”**

<br>

## _“**Paleontology” from within** **The New Gods**_

**\- “The flesh appears as an imposter, a fraud, a disguise which masks nothing. Was this all it was? And if it is worth no more, how does it manage to inspire me with repulsion or with terror?” (I ask myself this question all the time)**

**\- Speaking about the “flesh”: “those who made a great case for its insignificance: Buddha...”**

**\- “The vision I have of it is the vision of a gravedigger infected with metaphysics. Doubtless I am wrong to keep thinking about it; one cannot** _**live**_ **and lay much stress of it: a colossus would perish in the attempt.” (mystics and saints are conquerors)**

**\- “The horrible being the path of liberation...In the Middle Ages, a man made a regimen of salvation, he believed** _**energenically**_**: the corpse was in fashion.”**

**\- “Today, an edulcorated religion adheres only to “nice” hallucinations, to Evolution and to Progress.”**

**\- “In order to vanquish attachments...we should have to contemplate the ultimate nudity of a human being...wallow in the horror...in his physiology of an imminent corpse.** _**The vision would be a methodical, a controlled obsession, particularly salutary in ordeals. The skeleton excites us to serenity; the cadaver, to renunciation.”**_ **(my father in a box)**

**\- “...the monk...No one would gainsay the fact that he is in the process of disappearing.” (Ha!)**

**\- “Now more than ever, we should build monasteries...**_**for those who believe in everything and for those who believe in nothing. Where to escape? There no longer exists a single place where we can professionally execrate this world.”**_ **(Everything and Nothing)**

**\-** _**“In order to conceive, and to steep ourselves in, unreality, we must have it constantly present to our minds. The day we feel it, see it, everything becomes unreal, except that unreality which alone makes existence tolerable.”**_

**\- “We can discard an illusion, no matter how inveterate; but what to do when we are faced with the consistent, with the durable? If there is only what exists, if being spreads everywhere, how do we break away from it without falling to pieces?** _**The fear there is nothing is followed by the fear that there is something.**_ **(Ha!)**

**\- “Not that this world doesn't exist, but its reality is no such thing. Everything seems to exist and nothing exists.” (Maya)**

**\-** _**“Every concerted pursuit, even that of nirvana, if we are not free to abandon it, is a shackle as much as any other.”**_ **(Renunciation at it's fullest, to abandon your own happiness, Nietzsche, Vivekananda, Tillich, Therese, Kempis, born in a church/die in a church)**

**\- “To think without being any the wiser, or rather not to think at all but to remain** _**there**_ **and to devour the silence – that is where perspicacity should lead. No pleasure is comparable to that of** _**knowing**_ **we don't think. It will be objected, Isn't knowing we don't think still thinking? No doubt, but** _**the wretchedness of thought is surmounted for the time that, instead of leaping from idea to idea, we remain deliberately within just one, one which rejects all the rest and which dissolves itself as soon as it takes for its content its own absence.”**_ **(meditation on God, even though the word 'God' makes me cringe)**

**\- “We must act so that nothing is ours, beginning with desire, that generator of dread.”**

**\- “The world which causes it is reduced to a transitory assemblage of unreal elements. In short, our fear is intense in proportion as we give credence to the self and to the world...Only our triumph over things is real,** _**only our realization of unreality**_**, which our acumen constructs every day, every hour. To be delivered is to rejoice in this unreality, to seek it out each moment.” (Maya, Vivekananda)**

**\- “**_**Why then, knowing that in the last resort everything is unreal, still be carried away for such trifles? I am carried away, granted, but I am not involved, which is to say that I take no real interest.”**_ **(Karma Yoga, Therese, Tolstoy)**

**\- “Awakening is independent of intellectual capacities: a genius can be a dunce, spiritually speaking. Moreover, knowledge as such gets on no further. An illiterate can possess 'the eye of understanding' and thereby find himself above and beyond any scholar.” (Ramakrishna- Vivekananda's mentor)**

# 20\. Thomas Ligotti

\- “Like many who have tried their hand at metaphysics, Bahnsen declared that, appearances to the contrary, all reality is the expression of a unified, unchanging force— a cosmic movement that various philosophers have characterized in various ways.”

\- “As history confirms, people will change their minds about almost anything, from which god they worship to how they style their hair. But when it comes to existential judgments, human beings in general have an unfalteringly good opinion of themselves and their condition in this world and are steadfastly confident they are not a collection of self-conscious nothings.” (Ha! maya)

\- “As scientists, philosophers, and spiritual figures have testified, our heads are full of illusions; things, including human things, are not dependably what they seem.”

\- “Immune to the blandishments of religions, countries, families, and everything else that puts both average and above-average citizens in the limelight, pessimists are sideliners in both history and the media. Without belief in gods or ghosts, unmotivated by a comprehensive delusion, they could never plant a bomb, plan a revolution, or shed blood for a cause.”

\- “Since personal economic gain would be passé as a motive for the new humanity, there would be only one defensible incitement to work: to see one another through to the finish, a project that would keep everyone busy and not just staring into space while they waited for the end. There might even be bright smiles exchanged among these selfless benefactors of those who would never be forced to exist. And how many would speed up the process of extinction once euthanasia was decriminalized and offered in humane and even enjoyable ways?”

_\- “One would think that neuroscientists and geneticists would have as much reason to head for the cliffs because little by little they have been finding that much of our thought and behavior is attributable to neural wiring and heredity rather than to personal control over the individuals we are, or think we are. But they do not feel suicide to be mandatory just because their laboratory experiments are informing them that human nature may be nothing but puppet nature. Not the slightest tingle of uncanniness or horror runs up and down their spines, only the thrill of discovery. Most of them reproduce and do not believe there is anything questionable in doing so. If they could get a corpse to sit up on an operating table, they would jubilantly exclaim, “It’s alive!” And so would we. Who cares that human beings evolved from slimy materials?”_ (I always wonder why these scientists, and even some philosophers, can talk about, for instance, the 'multi-verse, with a smile, or describe it as liberating, Ha! What a joke: you are a robot, you are a nothing, every possible existence exists, your choices are not really choices since they will all be made)

\- “In experiencing the _uncanny_, there is a feeling of _wrongness_...Of course, our internal authority may itself be in the wrong, perhaps because it is a fabrication of consciousness based on a body of laws that are written only within us and not a detector of what is right or wrong in any real sense, since nothing really is right or wrong in any real sense.” (Otto is supposed to be the complete opposite of Ligotti, yet this is exactly what Otto says too, Heidegger)

\- (the feeling of 'Uncanny')“One day those shoes on the floor of your clothes closet may attract your eye in a way they never have before. Somehow they have become abstracted from your world, appearances you cannot place, lumps of matter without a fixed quality and meaning. You feel confused as you stare at them. What are they? What is their nature? Why should there be something rather than nothing?” (Heidegger)

\- “...the ultimate threat to ordinary folk who only want to live in a world and in a way that is natural and familiar to them and their families, even though they are darkly aware that this familiarity is a fabrication that may be invalidated.”

\- “In the normal course of events, both determinists and indeterminists are one in promoting some kind of operative morality. As guardians of our morale, they feel moral realism to be a necessary truth, whether it is objectively real, as it is to indeterminists, or subjectively “real,” as it is to determinists. Without this truth, or “truth,” we could not go on living as we always have and believe that being alive is all right.”

\- “Can one _really_ believe in determinism without going insane?...And those who really care cannot be anything but believers in some form of moral realism or “realism,” which buttresses the optimistic reality that most people call home and braces up everything you need in order to be you— your country, your loved ones, your job or vocation, your golf clubs, and, in an all around sense, your “way of life.” (can one really believe in the multi-verse without going insane?)

\- “Only after fealty to countries, gods, and families has been shucked off can we even think about coming to grips with the least endangered of fabrications— the self.”

\- _“Born a prince, so the story goes, the nascent Enlightened One, Siddhartha Gautama, embarked on a quest to neutralize his ego by first leaving behind his family, gods, and sociopolitical station— all in one stroke. But Buddha’s way requires a near inhuman dedication, and few of us have that kind of stamina.”_

\- “There are aspects of the scientific world-view which may be damaging to our mental well-being, and that is what everybody intuitively feels” (Metzinger’s emphasis; quoted in Trafford).”

\- “But could the vulgar materialist actually say that he or she is aware of being no one as a fact and still go on to pretend that he or she is someone? Would this not be another version of Metzinger’s asking “Can one really believe in determinism without going insane?”

\- “_cultural critic Jens Bjørneboe wrote that “he who hasn’t experienced a full depression alone and over a long period of time— he is a child.”_

_\- “In perfect knowledge there is only perfect nothingness, which is perfectly painful if what you want is meaning in your life.”_ (Ligotti makes this point after referencing Hume and his claim of reason being a 'slave to the passions', i.e. reason does not make us act. '...if there were a curative magic wand on the table eight feet away, it would be too much trouble to go over and pick it up.')

_\- “_It is all a vacuous affair with only a chemical prestige. _Nothing is either good or bad, desirable or undesirable_, or anything else except that it is made so by laboratories inside us producing the emotions on which we live. And to live on our emotions is to live arbitrarily, inaccurately— imparting meaning to what has none of its own. Yet what other way is there to live? Without the ever-clanking machinery of emotion, everything would come to a standstill. There would be nothing to do, nowhere to go, nothing to be, and no one to know.”

\- _“Buddhism and pessimism cannot be pried loose from each other. The likeness between them is simply too pronounced to be overlooked. Buddhists claim that they are not pessimists but realists...The only real discrepancy between the two philosophies is that hundreds of millions of Buddhists have accepted dukkha as the primary reality of existence. How queer that pessimists cannot boast such numbers. While it is not perceived as such by followers of this ancient religion, the disavowed fact is this: Buddhism is pessimism. Yet whereas the pessimism that dares speak its name is met with near universal incredulity, Buddhism may advertise as truth what no pessimist can prove— that suffering is basic to human existence and it should be the work of our lives to liberate ourselves from its grasp.”_

_\- “_Because no two minds are contoured alike, no one system or collocation of systems will ever be sized to fit all. If truth is what you seek, then the examined life will only take you on a long ride to the limits of solitude and leave you by the side of the road with _your_ truth and nothing else.” (this is a good thing, says Vivekananda)

\- “Since Buddhism’s only objective is attaining enlightenment, that high road to nirvana (see below), it is at one with other religions in pitching a brighter future for believers in deliverance from the woes of this world. One problem: Human beings are rarely so sensitive to the woes of this world that they feel a pressing need to reject all cravings for the pleasures of this world, as Buddhism would have them do. And it seems that any amount of pleasure is pleasure enough to get us to keep the faith that being alive is all right for everyone, or almost everyone, and will certainly be all right for any children we cause to be delivered into this world.”

\- “Consciousness makes it seem as if (1) there is something to do; (2) there is somewhere to go; (3) there is something to be; (4) there is someone to know. This is what makes consciousness the parent of all horrors, the thing that makes us try to do something, go somewhere, be something, and know someone, such as ourselves, so that we can escape our MALIGNANTLY USELESS being and think that being alive is all right rather than that which should not be.” (me- renounce, find the real Self)

_\- “...ego-death is a state that has nothing but anecdotal evidence to support it, which groups this phenomenon with mystical experiences and revealed religions.”_

_\-_ “And once our egos have been deposed, what would be left of us? By all recorded accounts, everything would be left except what Horwitz called “a vanity, an elaborate delusion, a ruse.”

\- “Both of these non-dualistic meta-realities do serve the purpose of making sense of human life in their own way. But whether they make us feel good does not seem to matter to either of them. We are just vehicles; they are the drivers. And wherever we are going, as Segal and Schopenhauer have assured us, along with every other individual whose consciousness has been opened to the vastness by whatever name or nature, we must keep in mind that we are not what we think we are.”

_\- “Just a little doubt slipped into the mind, a little trickle of suspicion in the bloodstream, and all those eyes of ours, one by one, open up to the world and see its horror. Then: no belief or body of laws will guard you; no friend, no counselor, no appointed personage will save you; no locked door will protect you; no private office will hide you. Not even the solar brilliance of a summer day will harbor you from horror. For horror eats the light and digests it into darkness.”_

\- “In his best-known work, The Denial of Death (1973), Becker wrote: _“I believe that those who speculate that a full apprehension of man’s condition would drive him insane are right, quite literally right.”_ Zapffe concluded that we kept our heads by “artificially limiting the content of consciousness.” Becker stated his identical conclusion as follows: “\[ Man\] literally drives himself into a blind obliviousness with social games, psychological tricks, personal preoccupations so far removed from the reality of his situation that they are forms of madness, but madness all the same.” Outlawed truisms. Taboo commonplaces.”

\- “In lieu of personal immortality, we are willing to accept the survival of persons and institutions that we regard as extensions of us— our families, our heroes, our religions, our countries.”

\-“In the end, though, his insistence that we must imagine Sisyphus as happy is as impractical as it is feculent.”

_\-“All civilizations become defunct. All species die out. There is even an expiration date on the universe itself.”, “...the universe as nothing in motion.”_ (this is super important)

\-“For the pessimist, everything considered in isolation from human suffering or any cognition that does not have as its motive the origins, nature, and elimination of human suffering is at base recreational, whether it takes the form of conceptual probing or physical action in the world— for example, delving into game theory or traveling in outer space, respectively. And by “human suffering,” the pessimist is not thinking of particular sufferings and their relief, but of suffering itself. Remedies may be discovered for certain diseases and sociopolitical barbarities may be amended. But these are only stopgaps. Human suffering will remain insoluble as long as human beings exist.”

\-“But to express with any adequacy a sense of the uselessness of everything, a nonlinguistic modality would be needed, some effusion out of a dream that amalgamated every gradation of the useless and wordlessly transmitted to us the inanity of existence under any possible conditions.”

\-“Any kind of existence is useless. Nothing is self-justifying. Everything is justified only in a relativistic potato-masher sense.”

\-“Christians, Jews, and Muslims have a real problem with a potato-masher system of being. Buddhists have no problem with a potato-masher system because for them there are no absolutes.”

\-“In truth, we have only one foot in the natural environment of this world. Other worlds are always calling us away from nature. We live in a habitat of unrealities— not of earth, air, water, and wildlife— and cradling illusion trounces grim logic every time.”

\-(On Zapffe) “To exposit why humanity should not further tarry on earth is one thing; to believe that this proposition will be agreeable to others is quite another.”

\-(Again, speaking on Zapffe) “The delusional will forever be with us, thereby making pain, fear, and denial of what is right in front of our face the preferred style of living and the one that will be passed on to countless generations.” (It seems that Zapffe and Ligotti are both haters of the Earthly, without (like Nietzsche says) any sense of the Other)

\-“One would think that neuroscientists and geneticists would have as much reason to head for the cliffs because little by little they have been finding that much of our thought and behavior is attributable to neural wiring and heredity rather than to personal control over the individuals we are, or think we are. But they do not feel suicide to be mandatory just because their laboratory experiments are informing them that human nature may be nothing but puppet nature. Not the slightest tingle of uncanniness or horror runs up and down their spines, only the thrill of discovery. Most of them reproduce and do not believe there is anything questionable in doing so.”

\-“Ordinary folk who have nothing to do with supernaturalism and the uncanny and who are resistant to the pessimism of fictions like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Thing, whose principals all suffer death or deformation in their fight to hang on to their lives and their humanity.” (sounds like most trivial interpretations of religion)

\-“...And those who really care cannot be anything but believers in some form of moral realism or “realism,” which buttresses the optimistic reality that most people call home and braces up everything you need in order to be you— your country, your loved ones, your job or vocation, your golf clubs, and, in an all around sense, your “way of life.”

\-“Only after fealty to countries, gods, and families has been shucked off can we even think about coming to grips with the least endangered of fabrications— the self.”

\-“Whatever makes us think that we are what we think we are lies in the fact that we have consciousness, which gives us a sense of being somebody, specifically a human somebody, whatever that may be, since we do not have a definition of “human” on which there is universal agreement. But we do agree that, if only in practice, we are all real-live selves, since we are all self-conscious. And once we have passed through every door that qualifies our selves in some way— be it by name, nationality, occupation, gender, or shoe size— we then stand before the door of consciousness— parent of all horrors. And that is all there is to our existence.”

\-(On Metzinger) ““There are aspects of the scientific world-view which may be damaging to our mental well-being, and that is what everybody intuitively feels”

\-“that you are nothing but a human puppet would not be impossible to believe. What now? Answer: Now you go insane.”, “But how much more can we take? How will the human race feel about knowing that there is no human race— that there is no one? Would this be the end of the greatest horror tale ever told? Or might it be the reinstatement of the way things had been before we had lives of our own? For now, those who cannot abide even Darwin’s theory without the Creator beside them seem to be safe.”

_\-“...cultural critic Jens Bjørneboe wrote that “he who hasn’t experienced a full depression alone and over a long period of time— he is a child.”_

\-“In the recumbence of depression, your information-gathering system collates its intelligence and reports to you these facts: (1) there is nothing to do; (2) there is nowhere to go; (3) there is nothing to be; (4) there is no one to know.”

\-“In perfect knowledge there is only perfect nothingness, which is perfectly painful if what you want is meaning in your life.”

\- “This is the great lesson the depressive learns: Nothing in the world is inherently compelling.”

\- “The alternatives are clear: to live falsely as pawns of affect, or to live factually as depressives, or as individuals who know what is known to the depressive.”

\- _“As a threat to human continuance, nihilism is as dead as God.”_ (me- as Seraphim says: people have grown up within a nihilistic framework and therefore do not “experience” Nihilism the way people a few hundred years ago may have felt it. The Nihilistic experience is needed again)

\-“Key to Nietzsche’s popularity with atheistic amoralists is his materialistic mysticism, a sleight of mind that makes the world’s meaninglessness into something meaningful and refashions fate into freedom before our eyes.”

\- _“Then it begins. This can’t be happening, you think— if you can think at all, if you are anything more than a whirlwind of panic. In reality, though, anything can happen now. This is the whispering undercurrent that creeps into your thoughts__— nothing is safe and nothing is off limits. All of a sudden something was set in motion that changed everything. Something descended upon you that had been circling above your life from the day you were born. And for the first time you feel that which you have never felt before— the imminence of your own death. There is no possibility for self-deception now. The paradox that came with consciousness is done with. Only horror is left. This is what is real. This is the only thing that was ever real, however unreal it may have seemed._ (me- great, brief description of the Nihilistic experience)

\- “No other life forms know they are alive, and neither do they know they will die. This is our curse alone. Without this hex upon our heads, we would never have withdrawn as far as we have from the natural...Simply put: _We are not from here._ If we vanished tomorrow, no organism on this planet would miss us. Nothing in nature needs us.”

\- “Even as we survive and reproduce, we know ourselves to be dying in a dark corner of infinity.”

\- “If human pleasure did not have both a lid and a time limit, we would not bestir ourselves to do things that were not pleasurable, such as toiling for our subsistence. And then we would not survive.”

\- “_Each breath could be our last. Under such an arrangement, we would either have to become Epicureans and not fear death or, more likely, we would divert from our consciousness the thought that we could die without so much as a heads-up and in the blink of an eye.”_

\- “Tønnessen believes that “intellectual honesty” must lead to “ontological despair,” ( reason does lead to God, since God is _seen_ through Nothingness and Despair, though still incomprehensible)

\- “And one thing we know is real: horror. It is so real, in fact, that we cannot be sure it could not exist without us. Yes, it needs our imaginations and our consciousness, but it does not ask or require our consent to use them. Indeed, horror operates with complete autonomy. Generating ontological havoc, it is mephitic foam upon which our lives merely float. And, ultimately, we must face up to it: Horror is more real than we are.”

\- “That we all deserve punishment by horror is as mystifying as it is undeniable.”

\- _“Being alive: decades of waking up on time, then trudging through another round of moods, sensations, thoughts, cravings— the complete gamut of agitations__— and finally flopping into bed to sweat in the pitch of dead sleep or simmer in the phantasmagorias that molest our dreaming minds. Why do so many of us bargain for a life sentence over the end of a rope or the muzzle of a gun? Do we not deserve to die?”_

\- “_No self now, consciously speaking. No feeling your old self or new self, false imaginings if you think about it, self-conscious nothings everywhere you look. No one to hear you weep or scream, making a go of it on your own, bye-bye. No bosom of nature, abandoned on the doorstep of the supernatural, minds full of flagrantly joyless possibilities, a real blunder that was, the human tragedy. No reality to speak of, nobody here but us puppets, contradictory beings, mutants who embody the contorted logic of a paradox. No immortality, ordinary folk and average mortals coming and going, can’t stay long, got an appointment with nonexistence, no alternative to consider, being alive was all right while it lasted, so they say. No life story with a happy ending to tell, only a contrivance of horror, then nothingness— and nothing else. No Free Will-to-live, no redemption by a Will-to-die, how depressing. No philosophies to peddle, pessimism a no-sale, optimism had to close its doors, too wicked to pass code. No meanings or mind-games, repressional mechanisms broke down, self-deception shuttered its windows. No awakening from a dream within a dream, mutation of consciousness__— parent of all horrors, best not mess with it, extinction looking better all the time. No more pleasure, what there was of it, a few crumbs left by chaos at feast, still a good supply of pain, though. No praiseworthy incentives, just bowel-movement pressures, potato-mashing relativism. No euthanasia, bad for the business of life, you’re on your own there, but watch out for the eternal return, most horrible idea in the universe. No loving God, omnipotence off duty and omniscience on leave, the deity He dead— the horror, the horror, even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison, blame it on the piecing together of dissociated knowledge. No compassionate Buddha, Body Snatchers got him, heard tell, or some kind of thing, maybe next lifetime. No Good-versus-Evil formulas around here, Azathoth running the show, human beings a mistake or a joke, something pernicious making a nightmare of our world. No being normal and real, the uncanny coming at you full speed, startling and dreadful. No ego-death— enlightenment by accident. No way out of harm’s way, better never to have been, worst saved for last. No Last Messiah, buried in the fingernails of midwives and pacifier makers, gone the way of messiahs past. No bleakness either, a failure indeed. No terror management by isolation, anchoring, distraction, sublimation. No tragedies to read or to write, death kept at a safe distance past the vanishing point down the road. No escape routes into a useless bliss, useless existence, malignantly so…”_

_\- “Some morbid citizens among us might become cataleptic with anxiety because their next breath may be their last, but most of us would not be wrecked by such unremitting worry.”_

<br>

<br>

“The belief in the possibility of long-lasting, high-flown pleasures is a deceptive but adaptive flimflam. It seems that nature did not make us to feel too good for too long, which would be no good for the survival of the species, but only to feel good enough for long enough to keep us from complaining that we do not feel good all the time. In the workaday world, complainers will not go far. When someone asks how you are doing, you had better be wise enough to reply, “I can’t complain.” _If you do complain, even justifiably, people will stop asking how you are doing._ Complaining will not help you succeed and influence people. You can complain to your physician or psychiatrist because they are paid to hear you complain. _But you cannot complain to your boss or your friends, if you have any. You will soon be dismissed from your job and dropped from the social register. Then you will be left alone with your complaints and no one to listen to them._

Perhaps then the message will sink into your head: If you do not feel good enough for long enough, you should act as if you do and even think as if you do. That is the way to get yourself to feel good enough for long enough and stop you from complaining for good, as any self-improvement book can affirm. But should you not improve, someone must assume the blame. And that someone will be you. This is monumentally so if you are a pessimist or a depressive. Should you conclude that life is objectionable or that nothing matters— do not waste our time with your nonsense. We are on our way to the future, and the philosophically disheartening or the emotionally impaired are not going to hinder our progress. If you cannot say something positive, or at least equivocal, keep it to yourself. Pessimists and depressives need not apply for a position in the enterprise of life. You have two choices: Start thinking the way God and your society want you to think or be forsaken by all. The decision is yours, since you are a free agent who can choose to rejoin our fabricated world or stubbornly insist on … what? That we should mollycoddle non-positive thinkers like you or rethink how the whole world transacts its business? That we should start over from scratch? Or that we should go extinct? Try to be realistic. We did the best we could with the tools we had. After all, we are only human, as we like to say. Our world may not be in accord with nature’s way, but it did develop organically according to our consciousness, which delivered us to a lofty prominence over the Creation. The whole thing just took on a life of its own, and nothing is going to stop it anytime soon. There can be no starting over and no going back. No major readjustments are up for a vote. And _no melancholic head-case is going to bad-mouth our catastrophe._ The universe was created by the Creator, damn it. _We live in a country we love and that loves us back. We have families and friends and jobs that make it all worthwhile. We are somebodies, not a bunch of nobodies without names or numbers or retirement plans. None of this is going to be overhauled by a thought criminal who contends that the world is not doubleplusgood and never will be. Our lives may not be unflawed— that would deny us a better future to work toward— but if this charade is good enough for us, then it should be good enough for you. So if you cannot get your mind right, try walking away. You will find no place to go and no one who will have you_. You will find only the same old trap the world over. _Lighten up or leave us alone. You will never get us to give up our hopes. You will never get us to wake up from our dreams. We are not contradictory beings whose continuance only worsens our plight as mutants who embody the contorted logic of a paradox._ Such opinions will not be accredited by institutions of authority or by the middling run of humanity. To lay it on the line, whatever thoughts may enter your chemically imbalanced brain are invalid, inauthentic, or whatever dismissive term we care to hang on you, who are only “one of those people.” _So start pretending that you feel good enough for long enough, stop your complaining, and get back in line._ If you are not as strong as Samson— that no-good suicide and slaughterer of Philistines— then get loaded to the gills and return to the trap. Keep your medicine cabinet and your liquor cabinet well stocked, just like the rest of us. _Come on and join the party. No pessimists or depressives invited. Do you think we are morons? We know all about those complaints of yours. The only difference is that we have sense enough and feel good enough for long enough not to speak of them. Keep your powder dry and your brains blocked._ Our shibboleth: “Up the Conspiracy and down with Consciousness.”

## _The Last Messiah_

_<br>
_

\- “One night in long bygone times, man awoke and _saw himself_. He saw that he was naked under cosmos, homeless in his own body. All things dissolved before his testing thought, wonder above wonder, horror above horror unfolded in his mind.”

\- “Life had overshot its target, blowing itself apart.”

\- “And now he can discern the outline of his biologicocosmic terms: He is the universe’s helpless captive, kept to fall into nameless possibilities. From this moment on, he is in a state of relentless panic. Such a ‘_feeling of cosmic panic_’ is pivotal to every human mind.”

\- “In depressive states, the mind may be seen in the image of such an antler, in all its fantastic splendour pinning its bearer to the ground.”

\- _“Why, then, has mankind not long ago gone extinct during great epidemics of madness? Why do only a fairly minor number of individuals perish because they fail to endure the strain of living – because cognition gives them more than they can carry?”_

\- “Psychiatry even works on the assumption that the ‘healthy’ and viable is at one with the highest in personal terms. Depression, ‘fear of life,’ refusal of nourishment and so on are invariably taken as signs of a pathological state and treated thereafter. _Often, however, such phenomena are messages from a deeper, more immediate sense of life, bitter fruits of a geniality of thought or feeling at the root of antibiological tendencies._ It is not the soul being sick, but its protection failing, or else being rejected because it is experienced – correctly – as a betrayal of ego’s highest potential.”

\- “In everyday interaction, isolation is manifested in a general code of mutual silence: primarily toward children, so these are not at once scared senseless by the life they have just begun, but retain their illusions until they can afford to lose them.”

\- “The craving for material goods (power) is not so much due to the direct pleasures of wealth, as none can be seated on more than one chair or eat himself more than sated. Rather, the value of a fortune to life consists in the rich opportunities for anchoring and distraction offered to the owner.”

\- “When a human being takes his life in depression, this is a _natural death_ of spiritual causes. The modern barbarity of ‘saving’ the suicidal is based on a hair-raising misapprehension of the nature of existence.”

\- “Only a limited part of humanity can make do with mere ‘changes’, whether in work, social life, or entertainment. The cultured person demands connections, lines, a progression in the changes. Nothing finite satisfies at length, one is ever proceeding, gathering knowledge, making a career. _The phenomenon is known as ‘yearning’ or ‘transcendental tendency.’...Any grounds for 'progressive optimism' are removed by this major psychological law._”

\- _“And if we use the word in a religious sense, only the latter description fits. For here, none has yet been clear about what he is longing for, but one has always a heartfelt awareness of what one is longing away from, namely the earthly vale of tears, one’s own inendurable condition. If awareness of this predicament is the deepest stratum of the soul, as argued above, then it is also understandable why the religious yearning is felt and experienced as fundamental.”_

\- “Is it possible for ‘primitive natures’ to renounce these cramps and cavorts and live in harmony with themselves in the serene bliss of labour and love? Insofar as they may be considered human at all, I think the answer must be no.” (Infinite/finite gap, selflessness seemingly impossible, the existential philosopher different than the mystic, meaninglessness more overwhelming than mystical experience)

\- “he absence of naturally (biologically) based spiritual activity shows up, for example, in the pervasive recourse to _distraction_ (entertainment, sport, radio – ‘the rhythm of the times’). Terms for anchoring are not as favourable – all the inherited, collective systems of anchorings are punctured by criticism, and anxiety, disgust, confusion, despair leak in through the rifts (‘corpses in the cargo.’)”

\- “If we continue these considerations to the bitter end, then the conclusion is not in doubt. As long as humankind recklessly proceeds in the fateful delusion of being biologically fated for triumph, nothing essential will change.”

## _Suicide Note_

_<br>
_

\- “The following is an experiment in nihilism. Already I have contradicted myself! How can one believe in disbelief? I might be a nihilist except that I don’t believe in anything. If there is no extant God and no extant gods, no good and no evil, no right and no wrong, no meaning and no purpose; if there are no values that are inherently valuable; no justice that is ultimately justifiable; no reasoning that is fundamentally rational, then there is no sane way to choose

between science, religion, racism, philosophy, nationalism, art, conservatism, nihilism, liberalism, surrealism, fascism, asceticism, egalitarianism, subjectivism, elitism, ismism.”

\- “If reason is incapable of deducing ultimate, nonarbitrary human ends, and nothing can be judged as ultimately more important than anything else, then freedom is equal to slavery; cruelty is equal to kindness; love is equal to hate; war is equal to peace; dignity is equal to contempt;

destruction is equal to creation; life is equal to death and death is equal to life.”

\- “...the most important question is whether there is an important question. The only serious question is whether there is anything to take seriously.”

\- “Can one live a philosophy of the nihilistic, reconciling meaninglessness with every thought and emotion at every moment? If active unbelief were the highest organizing principle of a life, would the consequence be rational self-destruction? Could suicide represent the pinnacle of the rational life realized?” (Vivekananda says a Rationalist must be ready to follow reason to its farthest conclusion, e.g. the self is an illusion, most atheists, and even theists, say they are 'following reason', but they aren't, most end up with worldly conclusions which do not go far enough, the end is the self-negation of the self, in order to embrace or attempt to recognize the True Self)

\- “Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.”

\- “Nihilism could be interpreted as the inherent paradox of living a belief in disbelief. So called “nihilism”, however, is more unbelief than belief in disbelief. _Unbelief is a condition reached through negation._ It is not a positive expression of belief in disbelief, but rather, the negative cumulative result of refuting and recognizing the groundlessness of any and every instance of belief encountered thus far: lack of justification for belief in the authority of the state, lack of

justification for belief in the authority of one’s instincts and emotions, and, lack of justification for belief that God exists.” (the seeming difference between Nihilism and skepticism)

\- “Willing death is, then, an attempt to live a nihilistic life.”

\- “If no values are inherently valuable, then life has no inherent value. If life has no inherent purpose, then its end could be directed towards its negation or death. Death could be posited as the highest value. Since the other secular values are premised upon life, death is the test of all the

others. To test life with death tests the most important question I can conceive of: whether there is an important question.”

\- _“The implications of life’s meaninglessness have not been elicited with sufficient ruthlessness._ My methodology is honesty to the point of absurdity; honesty without mercy; honesty unprejudiced by morals, aesthetics, faith, or hope. When all illusions have been dispelled, at the end of overcoming subjectivities, biases, and prejudices towards life, one encounters the possibility of rational negation of self-interest; rational self-annihilation; rational self-destruction. The experiment in nihilism is to seek out precisely those truths that are most deadly and destructive to me. To will death through truth and truth through death.”

\- “When all choices are equal, equality is compatible with total randomness. If all choices are equal, then the choice of death is equal to the choice of life. _If life is meaningless, then God_ _is nothing._ But a funny thing happened on the way to nihilistic self-destruction. It was precisely through radical disbelief that I discovered an evolutionary basis for God. _Most secular people in the West are simply not ruthless enough in their nihilism to vivisect belief to death._ Yet vivisecting belief to death exposes how the original monotheistic conception of God likely arose out of ruthless realism. _Monotheism may have originated out of a skeptical, nihilistic, materialistic_ _objectivity that annihilated the biologically based subjectivity of the self, and thus created something ‘out of nothing_’. (maybe God doesn't 'originate' with Nihilism, but can be 'found' through Nihilism) WOW- look how “far back” my thoughts were; not long ago at all, maybe a few months)

\- “The attempt to be consistently materialistic yielded the tentative conclusion that the attempt to be consistently materialistic is rational self-destruction.”

\- “Perhaps the whole experiment in nihilism is a failure simply because I somehow managed to make it too meaningful.”

\- “Nihilism turns out to be more paradoxical than I first thought. The Singularity does not refute nihilism, but rather, “God” may _be_ technological nihilism — yet only in the same sense in which a human being is technological nihilism as a gene replicating machine.”

\- “My formula for self-destruction is truth seeking. Doing so diverts me away from a normal path, the biological path or the path of life, and the entire mythological cave of human relationships.”

\- “Psychological explanations can be used, not only to evade the nihilistic, but to evade the scientific equation of the larger material world with a material view of one’s own mind — and thus to misunderstand the problem.”

\- _“When I say that I do not believe in my emotions, I don’t meant that I don’t have them; I mean that I do not accord them any ultimate meaning or significance._ Darwin’s The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals demonstrates why: emotions and instincts are the product of

evolutionary adaptations that happened to be adaptive for generations of ancestors. _I do not_

_believe in my emotions, however much I continue to be driven by them. This, on a human level, this is what nihilism or unbelief means._ On the most plain, down to earth and human level, this is really where the entire “experiment in nihilism” arose. The experiment in nihilism is really only

the consequence or extension of this original experiment on myself. _After exploring an unadulterated materialistic view, life lost its cogency for me.”_

\- “The experiment in nihilism is a test of what I really do or do not believe. If it is the case that emotions are former genetic adaptations or illusions of an evolutionary inheritance, the chance products of a particular course of natural selection, then there is no reason to assume that they

are guides beyond their original adaptive functions. This also means that everyone else and their emotions are also treatable as physical material.”

\- “Self-consistent materialism leads to interpreting every subjective experience, i.e. fear, love, inspiration, dreams, etc., as physical matter.”

\- “If humans are emotion machines, then music must work, in some sense, like a machine.

Music could be a form of emotional technology to control my own behavior intelligently. In other words, if emotions are the products of material processes, then art could be viewed as a form of

technology. From the standpoint of this musical materialism, as one of the most extreme implications of an unadulterated materialism, lay a possible solution to dominance of my own

analytic and objective tendency to materialize everything. _I began to listen to music, especially German music (and especially Wagner and Bach), as a form of technology to counter my own tendencies to view everything as material or technology.”_

_\- “Bach is ground from outside of myself that makes up for the nihilistic lack of ground within myself. Bach counters my material self-consistency and its tendency towards self-decomposition_

_with a form of holistic-mind order._”

\- “It is a fundamental hypothesis of this work that, not indifference, but an active blind spot to certain kinds of “truth”, certain kinds of objectivity, is the condition of biological human life. _Martin Heidegger is what happens when one believes in one’s own emotions, i.e. poetry.”_

\- “If life is truly meaningless and there is no rational basis for choosing among fundamental

alternatives, then all choices are equal and there is no fundamental ground for choosing life over death.”

\- “Liberals are not at all fully nihilistic. In part, there is the practical belief in values vaguely corresponding to human rights. But more fundamentally, “secularists” implicitly

believe in a religion of the common emotions. They generally believe that meaning is to be found in the material, biochemical processes that humans experience as emotions.”

\- “Were Nietzsche and the Athenians right about Socrates? Reason appears unable to determine values and, therefore, the entire Western pretension to rationalism is a kind of joke. And even worse, it’s not even a good joke.”

\- _“From a Darwinistic view, every capacity for emotion evolved as a product of genetic adaptation. Emotions, then, are biochemical-based illusions that evolved to propagate genes. Pleasure, happiness, emotions, and desire: these are the evolutionary tricks that promoted the survival of our ancestors. The “happiness” and “sadness” of present day humans are the genetically adaptations of generations of ancestors. This is “happiness”, the great goal of humanity has been striving for: a particular configuration of biochemical reactions.”_ (Ha!)

\- “For some, the meaninglessness gleaned from a scientific view of life leads to nausea, angst, and nihilistic despair. I reject this attitude on the grounds that nausea, angst, and nihilistic despair also originate in material reactions in the brain. What does despair mean to someone who interprets that emotion as a chemical reaction in the brain? The process of disillusionment can also be disillusioned and de-aestheticized.”

\- “What is closest to total indifference is to be dead. If an observer hypothesizes death then, from that perspective, the observer has no vested interests in life and thus possible grounds for

the most objective view. _The more an observer is reduced to nothing, the more the observer is no longer a factor, the more the observer might set the conditions for the most rigorous objectivity.”_ (selflessness)

\- _“It is likely that most people will not even consider the veracity of this correlation between death and objectivity even if they understand it intellectually because most will consciously or unconsciously choose to place the interests of self-preservation over the interests of objectivity._ In other words, to even consider the validity of this view assumes that one is willing and able to even consider prioritizing objectivity over one’s own self-preservation. Since it not safe to simply assume this on an individual level, let alone a social level, relatively few are willing and able to seriously address this issue (and majority consensus can be expected to dismiss the issue). _In short, for most people, including most “scientists”, overcoming self-preservation is not ultimately a subject for rational debate and objective discussion.”_ (the path is narrow, most people are not philosophers, Taoism and the supremacy of direct experience)

\- “I cannot fully reconcile my understanding of the world with my existence in it.”

\- “To pursue science, scientists must be justified by something that, strictly speaking, is not science itself, i.e. curiosity, wonder, faith in science, the will to master all knowledge, belief that

it will benefit the world, belief in pure knowledge for its own sake, or some other breach of objectivity. Because science, apparently, cannot consistently justify itself, something else must if it is to exist at all.”

\- “The attempt to eliminate all subjective bias would culminate in the elimination of science, for science has failed to produce evidence that it is capable of fully justifying itself. _The very existence of science is the strongest evidence that scientists are less than fully objective. An attempted self-consistent objectivity is a self-destructing objectivity, since the bias of the subjective belief in the value of objectivity must be removed to be objective. This implies that an_

_objective “theory of all” could not account for itself.”_

_\-_ “How, then, does a scientist choose a subject to study? Is there a way to objectively determine what the subject of objectivity should be? Is there a fundamentally objective reason for choosing the study of archaeology over the study of chemistry? Is the decision to study Sanskrit over Chinese more rational than the decision to worship Allah over not worshiping Allah? Is there a fundamentally rational ground for making one choice over another?”

\- “Even once one has decided on some facet of reality, there is still the problem of interpretation. Consider the interpretation that my interpretation is just a way of throwing order upon the chaos of the world. Is this interpretation itself a just a way of throwing order on the chaos of the world? Even the word “chaos” imposes a kind of order over (things), which cannot (?) be put into (words). _In any case, if objectivity cannot justify itself then objectivity is subjective in the sense of being selective; one must always determine what the dominant factors are; what is important; the value of facts. Some facts are valued at the expense of others. Some things are selected for study, while others are neglected or demoted. I can find no definitive, objective way to choose one subject or field of inquiry over another. Why am I even reflecting on this problem right now_

_at the expense of some other problem?_ This work thus appears, by definition, subjective, in that I chose certain domains as subjects of objectivity at the expense of others. How, then, can I justify the subjects I “choose” to be objective about?”

\- “If I had no biases I would _be_ dead, rather that sitting here right now, writing about them.” (this is towards the end of the letter. The misspellings and poorly structured sentence says a lot in a 'strange/poor' way. It's almost as if he is 'cracking')

\- “By simply changing my values from life values to death values, and setting my trajectory for rational biological self-destruction, I am able to liberate myself from many of the biases that

dominate the horizons of most people’s lives.” (I feel Mckenna might say this in a more 'optimistic' fashion)

_\- “This means, however, that for the average Westerner who plays the basic ‘Euclidean’ rules of the liberal democratic system, my ‘non-Euclidean’ logic will likely appear to be “irrational”. It may appear repugnant to the “nature” of individual self-preservation. Yet if my theory is nearly_

_universally condemned, does this mean that I do not have a valid point or does it mean_

_that other observers are not willing to prioritize objectivity over the bias of self-preservation?”_ (jean amery speaks of the 'logic of life' and the 'logic of death' which is why he thinks that most psychological theories have 'some truth' to them, but they all hinge of an unjustified preference for life)

_\- “My objective is to kill myself. Now how can I explain this? If reason cannot determine ultimate values, then how do I explain the facts of my values? I can begin to explain myself through the Nietzschean distinction between truth and life. It is a modern delusion to believe that pursuit of truth has any necessary correspondence with life-affirming values. To not gloss over the forks between these paths with myths and compromises, but to confront them openly, directly, and as far as possible, without illusion, can lead to the path of truth and death.”_

_\- “_Yet if Gödel is right, then it may be that to understand yourself is to understand that you can

never fully understand yourself.”

_\- “The attempt to fully include one’s self in one’s own theory can never, it seems, be achieved._ However, the attempt to approach this state amounts to a process of rational self-destruction because, _in order to approach objectivity, the elimination of subjectivity must proceed, and the elimination of all self-interest approaches the elimination of biases of life over death._ _Rational self-destruction that culminates in death is correlated with the most thorough attempt at_

_scientific objectivity_: the attempt to include one’s self in one’s own scientific Weltanschauung. The impossible goal of self-consistent objectivity nonetheless approaches a definition of suicide or death through the attempt at the consistent elimination of biases towards life.”

\- “I cannot synthesize this work with my living, sociobiological existence. I cannot live with the implications of my work and this leaves the possibility of separating the interests of truth and life.” (this is an almost 'sad/desperate' paragraph coming from someone who is cracking under the pressure of existence, of being. Nihilism, or naturalism vs theism, material vs non-temporal are seemingly irreconcilible, which leads to what Heisman refers to as 'rational self-destruction)

\- “The literal act of killing myself is a literal act of willing the progress of equality — the equality of the biological and the physical — by _overcoming biological boundaries that preserve biology “above” the larger physical environment._ Biological life or biological self-preservation, in other words, has no superior status to any other form of matter. _This work embodies acts that rationally and systematically deprive my life of the conditions of its own self-preservation. Rational self-destruction is posited here as the actualization of an experiment to test a tentative_

_nihilism.”_

<br>

\- _“Just as life is a process, the undoing of life is also a process or “progress”. My writings are daily affirmations of death. I am painting myself into a corner until there is only one inevitable act left. I am killing every belief and breaking down every value that upholds my very life until what is left_

_is nothing. An experiment in nihilism, I am destroying all values that uphold life until I am left with nowhere to stand.”_ (this is renunciation, this is what I am doing)

<br>

_\- “When all choices are equal, equality is compatible with total randomness. If all choices are equal, then the choice of death is equal to the choice of life. If life is meaningless, then God is nothing._ (this is above, but important enough to stand out as a repeat)

<br>

\- “When my father died when I was twelve, I dealt with his death by interpreting him as a purely material phenomenon. In other words, I viewed my father as a material thing and his death as a material process. Well before my father died, I had interpreted my own emotions as material processes and my reaction to my father’s death was treated no differently. If I treat myself and understand myself by the standard of physical materialism, there is no reason why I should not do the same to others who, by the same Darwinistic understanding of life, are also physical material.”

\- “From a materialist, Darwinist standpoint, I and every other human is an animal and a

material object. All emotions, whether joy or misery, elation or depression, are rooted in behavior that proved to be genetically adaptive for animal ancestors.” (this is not a piece of apologetics from an evangelical christian, this is a dude who held to this, experienced this materialist worldview, and killed himself from it)

_\- “The distinction between the desire to know and the will to know is key here. The desire to know, motivated only by curiosity or pleasure, tends to be selective. The desire to know tends to ignore, repress, or otherwise not confront what is not conducive to pleasure or happiness. The will to_

_know is confrontation with all as it comes in life and a seeking out of the least pleasurable and the least joyous truths. This distinction is imperative here because I interpreted happiness, pleasure,_

_and joy itself as “material”, as the product of physical processes, and strove to overcome_

_submission to their biasing influence.”_ (how is this any different than Vivekananda or Kierkegaard in his _will one thing_?)

_\- “The decisive turn that made me different, or consummated my self-destructive difference from others, was really this experiment on myself where I systematically interpreted all subjective experience: emotions, experiences, intuitions, instincts as physical material; not better or worse_

_than any other physical material. This experiment, in its conception, amounts to a definition of disillusionment. Originally, the procedure was built on a radical selfishness— not belief in selfishness, but a tentative-programmatic one based on the tentative assumption that no premise is_

_fundamentally justified.”_ (fuck, this Naturalism is 'disillusionment', agreed)

\- “Emotions are the root of beliefs. To destroy all beliefs, all belief in emotion must be destroyed.

After systematically interpreting my emotions are material processes for at least a year and a half, the cause of _life simply lost its cogency._”

\- _“Disillusioned of belief in my own subjective experiences, at rock bottom, I turned to completely destroy myself. If life itself is without ultimate meaning, and is not fundamentally_

_rationally superior to death, then perhaps the test of the worth of life is found in willing death and self-destruction.”_

_\-”_Instead of attempting to overcoming my socially self-destructive tendencies, I gave them free reign. Instead of doing what strengthening, I do what is weakening. Instead of doing what is considered socially acceptable, I do what is considered humiliating. These little self-destructions help feed the larger ones. Yet, at the same time, it means in at least some respects, it means I

pay my rent and work out to keep myself physically fit, so I am in a position to achieve the most rational and most comprehensive self-negation.” (fuck, this is me)

_\- “_So what, then, are the psychological characteristics of such a person who engages in such self-destructive behavior? _Whatever the psychological quirks I might possess, my central problem is nihilism. Can the meaninglessness of existence be cured with therapy? Lie therapy, whether religious or secular, is overwhelmingly the normative state of the human race. Put another way, there may be sound psychological reasons why radical nihilism is not a condition prescribed by therapists. Yet if psychologists are scientists, and their own methodology confirms the scientific view of human beings as material things in motion, on what grounds can they criticize nihilism in itself?_ Only insofar as psychologists are not scientists; insofar as _they are non-objective partisans of the ‘life party’ are psychologists fundamentally and irrevocably biased against consideration_

_of my point of view._ _Psychological explanations can be used, not only to evade the nihilistic, but to evade the scientific equation of the larger material world with a material view of one’s own mind — and thus to misunderstand the problem.”_ (the idea of 'mental illness' not being what it is normally defined as. Tillich makes this distinction, as does Becker, e.g. what could psychotherapy possibly say to the Nihilist? Nihilism is seeing the world correctly, happiness is for the pigs, Zapffe all say this)

_\- “_I have become disenchanted and have lost spontaneous naivety to an extent that all efforts to

regain the cause of life ring hollow and fall flat.”

_\- “_You must in some sense believe the subjective state of fear, and not anticipate and out-compete it with an objective, physical-material reduction, in order to take it seriously.”

_\- “The most consistent physicalism, a physicalism that makes no exceptions whatsoever for subjective experiences such as instincts, intuitions, and emotions, leads to rational self-destruction or rational death. Self-consistent materialism leads to interpreting every subjective experience, i.e. fear, love, inspiration, dreams, etc., as physical matter.”_ (again, this is not an evangelical christian speaking, this is the consequences of a Naturalistic worldview)

_\-_ “My formula for self-destruction is truth seeking.”

\- “...I ultimately concluded that unadulterated material objectivity was probably the most basic source of the problem itself...This meant that I could take myself apart in some ways, but I could not put myself back together.”

\- “If life is truly meaningless and there is no rational basis for choosing among fundamental

alternatives, then all choices are equal and there is no fundamental ground for choosing life over death. Yet since I do not believe in nihilism, why not test “nihilism”? _Perhaps I am wrong, but if_

_the question of whether there is an important question is the most important question, then testing this question is closest thing to importance. Since counterarguments almost always_

_take their starting point with a bias towards existence, to criticize this bias is to take a starting that is open to the possibility of death._” (Amery)

\- “Every word, every thought, and every emotion come back to one core problem: life is

meaningless. The experiment in nihilism is to seek out and expose every illusion and every myth, wherever it may lead, no matter what, even if it kills us.”

\- “_Who is to say that a life of a saint, an artist, or a philosopher is superior to a life sniffing glue.”_

\- “To engage in human relationships is to dwell within a mythological world.”

\- “While one may feel compassion, does this mean that one lacks the capacity to discipline one’s self from being mastered by that impulse. That people are mastered by such impulses is only another confirmation of Darwin’s insight that humans are animals. Most humans are driven

overwhelmingly by instinct and emotion.”

\- “If reason cannot determine fundamental values, then reason can be used to justify literally anything.”

\- “Nihilism, noted Friedrich Nietzsche, “represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals”. This is the bankrupt, philosophical disaster area the West dwells in. I see no “bottom”, no limits to stop the freefall into value nothingness. Implicit in nihilism is the

collapse of the entire human cause. The ultimate logical conclusion of Western values is the rational self-destruction of the West. Is this absurd? If this is absurd then it must also be absurd

that I rage at the entire cosmos for having no ultimate meaning. But there is no reason to be pessimistic. There is no justification whatsoever for a negative attitude! There is no justification whatsoever for a positive attitude! There is no justification whatsoever for a neutral attitude!”
